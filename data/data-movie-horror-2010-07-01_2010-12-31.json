After having admitted his guilt and serving his sentence, he's being picked up outside the prison yard by his probably faithful wife for a long-awaited reunion. Unfortunately, in the following weeks, reality sets in when his felony record makes his repeated attempts to rejoin the workforce humbling and futile. His most recent job interview results in his bending his elbow at a watering hole. Too much to drink and an errant suspicious pill causes our disappointed husband and father to seek advice from a soothsayer who runs a weird little shop a few doors down from the bar. Under the influence and under the gun, a deal is struck in the fortune teller's lair which proves to be \"too good to be true\"? As if a beaded curtain has been parted, Jonas' life immediately turns around. Job offers. Money. Luxurious home and cars. Happiness. Family times. Until the bill is due. And who comes to collect? The most vile, hellish, repugnant demon who was ever vomited from --- well, another place and time. The Entity has all the tools to wreck all she sees. To ingest all that's good and discharge pure evil. Will Jonas have to pay the piper? A cold, grinning evil collects, with certainty - both his wife and son! A broken man, Jonas Littleton divests himself of every remnant of wealth and possession. He uses the proceeds to follow his heart and soul's remaining task. His course is clear - he must track down the Entity and extract his revenge - or die trying. Now he runs Paranormal Investigations Incorporated to soothe his damaged soul and feed his obsession. He sees the Entity in every investigation in reality or maybe not. His sanity hinges on the pursuit. Continuing his quest for revenge, he leads his investigation team from haunting to haunting, until one day he comes face to face with the Entity. How this final confrontation between a wounded-spirit human and the very essence of conniving, grinning evil plays out will knock your socks off! Twists and turns abound. You'll not believe your eyes.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEwZDA1MzctY2FkMC00NzkzLTkwZDUtMzZmN2M5ODE4YmJkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR6,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1563121/","userScore":4,"voteCount":56,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":91,"budgetUsd":100000,"diretores":[["Charles Peterson","nm0677064"]],"escritores":[["David C.

Scott finds Native American relics and becomes more and more entranced in the mystery of the house, so, of course, he is ecstatic when he finds a working video camera and starts reviewing the tapes. He sees a family member filming his family in an otherwise harmless video. But as he continues to watch, he notices that these videos are more and more sinister. When the battery dies, Scott leaves Trisha inside to plug the camera into his truck and continue watching. Who is filming? Why are they hidden in the woods? What is he seeing?! He will begin to wish he had never discovered the house, the camera or the unseen dark secrets.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1326272/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Crime","Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Ray Nicholas Hosack","nm0003578"]],"escritores":[["Ray Nicholas Hosack","nm0003578"]],"atores":[["Ross Preller","nm0695895"],["Julin","nm2734149"],["Michael Austin Parker","nm3184186"],["Hunter Garner","nm0307714"],["Josh Durham","nm2397495"],["Cody Hinson","nm3065660"],["Tetia Stroud","nm1408028"],["Kendall Mitchell","nm3199010"],["James Daniel Burns Williams","nm3102997"],["Heather Okun","nm2176580"],["Madelyn Rae Hosack","nm3200514"],["Lucas Cole Hosack","nm3201364"],["Brad Hartliep","nm2397104"],["Scott Wheelis","nm2308812"],["Mo Bowers","nm3198932"],["Shikha Malhotra","nm7602920"]]},{"title":"Secret Sunday","description":"At his mother's request, Nat, a young architect, unwillingly takes a journey to visit nine different temples in order to clean up his bad karma.

Invited to participate in a private GEO-CACHE race the girls have the chance to win ten thousand dollars. Unfortunately, Trish soon realizes that while she is hunting for the prize cache, something else is hunting her. Tortured by the tragedies of her families' past, and facing the evils they have long hidden, Trish must learn to rely on herself if she is to survive. HIDDEN moves well beyond a simple slasher flick and into a dark world of emotional terror. HIDDEN...The Only Thing You'll Find Is DEATH!!! \"Hidden is clearly a low budget tribute to 80s slasher films. The effects are cgi, but are used in such a great way that Hidden is one of the very few low budget movies that actually benefits from them! And, the final scene will have you both wondering what the hell is going on, and what might come next for Trish and her friends! I'm giving Hidden 3 out of 4 cigars, it's not perfect, but it's a cool little indie film that doesn't try to overstep its budget, or over-complicate its plot to compensate for its smaller budget. Writer/director Bill Houser has given us an 80s slasher movie that might have actually been made in the 80s...if you love movies like the original Friday The 13th, Happy Birthday To Me or April Fool's Day, then you're going to love Hidden! Its low budget, but it's still gonna make you want to avoid those wilderness hikes for a while!\" Brian Morton, Roguecinema.com","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg0YTBiYTItNzFiOS00OGE3LTkyNjItNjIzZDJkOTA0ZmFiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR2,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3140578/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Horror"],"runtimeMin":86,"budgetUsd":10000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["William Houser","nm3240669"]],"escritores":[["William Houser","nm3240669"]],"atores":[["Ellen Hinch","nm6955646"],["Michael Lesley","nm6955649"],["Dakeeta Planty","nm6955647"],["Russel Toolate","nm6955648"]]},{"title":"Nosferatu","description":"A gay couple arrives to a mysterious \"gay friendly\" hostel to solve their marital problems.

But nothing is as simple as it seems in a film that has more twists and turns than a mountain road - David has secrets of his own, including a tortured past that even he doesn't fully remember or understand, and a burgeoning love affair with Laura Watson, the new girl in town, who may also be more than she seems. Also in the mix are vampire hunters - Dr. Simon Polidori and his daughter Miranda, who have an agenda of their own, which involves using David as bait for Langstrom. Meanwhile, David's best friend and business partner, Oliver Seward, thinks that David is going a bit nuts, but he remains steadfast, even when called upon to help combat a creature that he doesn't really believe exists. Finally, there are Langstrom's victims - Emily Parker, a girl David meets at a bar in Toronto... Amanda Doyle, the deputy mayor of Harker's Cove... and Stephanie Fielding, a young lawyer who specializes in \"real estate\" exclusively for one client. All of them are just pawns in her game, as she maneuvers everyone towards a final showdown which was prophesied centuries before. In the end, however, it all comes down to a choice for David - destiny, or free will - and the question of whether true love can really conquer all!","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1720101/","userScore":5,"voteCount":8,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Horror"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":700000,"diretores":[["Paul Andrew Kimball","nm3531377"]],"escritores":[["Paul Andrew Kimball","nm3531377"]],"atores":[["Joseph Gallaccio","nm4062697"],["Laura Bleasdale","nm2448307"],["Carly Street","nm0834065"],["David Connellan","nm4060868"],["Christina Cuffari","nm3516523"],["Nigel Bennett","nm0000911"],["Vanessa Furlong","nm3577169"],["Holly Stevens","nm3184854"],["Tara Slone","nm0806163"],["Amy Kerr","nm0449643"],["Sandy MacLean","nm3399714"],["Kate Mullan","nm1249855"],["Mack Murray","nm4062363"],["Kathleen Mullan","nm1026398"]]},{"title":"Schwerelos","description":"18th Century: Five children spend the day outside in a mysterious garden.

Fear was a luxury I could not afford.\" Introduction Praying for Death is a documentary film that will illustrate the story of Gouri Amma of Khargapur, India. Gouri is a widow who, after her husband's untimely death, takes on the normally male-held tradition of cremating the dead. Her husband Kakalu was the local dome, or cremator, for employees of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway in the Midnapore district of Kharagpur. Through Gouri's faith and determination, she struggles to support herself and three daughters against what seem like overwhelming odds. With the unexpected help of a local attorney, and the community in which Gouri lives, a neglected crematorium area is eventually transformed to a place worthy of respect and admiration. Gouri herself gains the recognition she deserves for her role as the local domni. The story will weave elements of social and economic class struggles, religious beliefs and traditions, changing roles in society, and the legal system in rural Southern India. Praying for Death will be a snapshot of rural Indian life at the crossroads of change, using the documentary film genre as the venue for social commentary. As with any ethnographic study, the film will explore what is unique in the lives of its characters, and at the same time help to bridge cultural notions and reveal what is universal in the human experience. Themes of current interest that will be explored are:","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2OTMxMDU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDYxNTA2MDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR111,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1745789/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Documentary","Family","Horror","News"],"runtimeMin":33,"diretores":[["Sunil Brij Bhan","nm3696634"]],"escritores":[["Sunil Brij Bhan","nm3696634"],["Ron Marvin","nm4125852"]],"atores":[["Sunil Brij Bhan","nm3696634"],["Gretchen Meddaugh","nm3698803"],["Shekhar Patil","nm3904756"]]},{"title":"Belligerent Moose vs. The Army of Flesh Eaters","description":"Belligerent Moose, a punk band from Cleveland kicks out there drug addict drummer.
