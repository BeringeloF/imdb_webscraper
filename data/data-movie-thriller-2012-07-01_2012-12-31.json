It seems to be just the distraction they need, until the day Paul is kidnapped by human traffickers who need a surgeon to operate on their wounded leader. Kim is left alone in a strange country, trying desperately to find her husband with no proof of what happened. While captive on the gangs' secluded island, Paul is caged with Malcolm Andrews (John Rhys-Davies), an Englishman being held for ransom. With nothing to do but talk, the two men quickly clash over philosophy, as Malcolm relies on a bold faith in God and Paul believes no god would allow these evils to happen in the world. Paul takes another hit when he finds his patient's condition much worse than he can handle on his own in such primitive conditions. With his value to the criminals plummeting, the only hope for both he and Malcolm is to plot their own escape. They must trust each other with their very lives in order to outwit the traffickers and make a run for freedom.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMyNjRiN2QtNDM4ZC00MDBjLWIwNzYtMWM4NjcxOWI3N2FkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2147277/","userScore":4.5,"voteCount":790,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":90,"diretores":[["Paul Emami","nm1164403"]],"escritores":[["Andrea Gyertson Nasfell","nm0621665"]],"atores":[["C.

Outside, it's raining incessantly. The story's three parts, each with a relative as protagonist, reveal contradictions between faith, generations and views of the future. Atmospheric film about old and new Indonesia. In three chapters, the relationships are sketched within one Indonesian family. The first scenes are set in the father's house, just after the dinner which ends the fast. The family is sitting at the table, minus mother: son Ragil with another new girlfriend, son Raga who still lives at home and daughter Ade. After the departure of the others, Raga and his father are left behind. Their visibly loving relationship, portrayed calmly and implicitly, is overshadowed by a secret. Chapter two is set on the way to, and in, the house of the divorced mother, where the daughter Ade lives and experiences events that transcend normal reasoning. The last part looks at Ragil, girlfriend Sukma and an ex-girlfriend who suddenly turns up. Although each chapter is told in the same calm tempo, they are different in character and tone and we see three films in one: drama, horror and comedy - always with an unexpected turn.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM4YmZiMjgtMWY1NS00MjdkLTg2M2UtYjFmNWI1NzY4OWMzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Rumah dan Musim Hujan","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2549996/","userScore":7.5,"voteCount":90,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":100,"diretores":[["Ifa Isfansyah","nm2856917"]],"escritores":[["Ifa Isfansyah","nm2856917"]],"atores":[["Tora Sudiro","nm1417112"],["Vino G.

LAURA LOHNER is his prime suspect in a web of S&M games filled with prostitutes and high class hookers. There's one problem: Laura has the perfect motive...but she also has the perfect alibi. When FRANK LOHNER is found shot dead execution style, with six bullets to his body and an unconscious (and drugged) beautiful prostitute at his side, DETECTIVE ADAMS suspects Laura Lohner and sets out to question STAR, the young prostitute about her connections to Laura. As he delves deeper into the suspicious connections between the two women, the detective sets a trap to catch Laura in the act of pulling strings.

So far, two women have fallen victim to the serial killer, a lawyer and a prostitute. Apart from their gruesome end, there doesn't seem to be any connection between the two. Chief Inspector Jan Fabel and his teammates Maria Klee, Henk Herrmann, the police psychologist Dr. Susanne Eckhardt and the new employee Anna Wolff are under great pressure to succeed. In addition to his superior, Fabel is also backed by an LKA officer who is showing unusual interest in the case. At the same time, the murderer engages the chief inspector in a macabre game by sending him emails with encrypted messages. Fabel feverishly pursues every lead. Nevertheless, the wanted person is always one step ahead of his pursuers. Soon the landlord of the murdered prostitute, Hans Klugmann, is targeted by the investigators. He used to be with the police himself, now he's on the payroll of the Turkish mafia. Henk and Anna begin to observe the man's surroundings. They witness a bloody shootout between rival groups of the Turkish and Ukrainian mafia. At first, Fabel does not believe in any connection to his case. Only gradually are the indications that the investigators are not only dealing with the insane follower of a bizarre cult of Odin. Rather, Fabel and his colleagues are on the trail of a large-scale coup by the Ukrainian mafia. Its leader apparently has allies in the police. And he will stop at nothing to get unwelcome witnesses out of the way.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1ODUzNjg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk1MzM4MDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2186701/","userScore":5.2,"voteCount":138,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Nils Willbrandt","nm0929660"]],"escritores":[["Daniel Martin Eckhart","nm0248676"],["Craig Russell","nm3793605"]],"atores":[["Numan Acar","nm1485637"],["Stephan Bissmeier","nm0084346"],["Gunda Ebert","nm0248137"],["Michael Fuith","nm1845127"],["Philipp Hochmair","nm0387832"],["Ina Paule Klink","nm0459819"],["Bernd Michael Lade","nm0480487"],["Peter Lohmeyer","nm0517885"],["Merab Ninidze","nm0632457"],["Lisa Maria Potthoff","nm0693383"],["Daniela Schulz","nm1658560"],["Hinnerk Schönemann","nm1091185"],["Marie-Lou Sellem","nm0783317"]]},{"title":"Psychophony","description":"Psychiatrist Dr. Helena Jarra conducts a series of psychological experiments on several patients afflicted with schizophrenia in order to prove that schizophrenia is connected with paranormal phenomena.

Rudger was in jail for ten years. Now, after his release, he wants his wife and child back - presto. One thing is immediately clear to Jan: The man cannot be dealt with, with homeopathic doses. Heavier guns have to be deployed. Go to the police? It does not work. But a former old acquaintance named Steve, who got on the wrong track, could be the solution - after all, he knows a lot about people like Rudger. Thanks to his good contacts to clubs that are always ready to go, Steve wants to get rid of the problem called Rudger from his old friend Jan. Against appropriate payment, of course. But the action goes wrong, Rudger is maddened, and panic spreads among the thugs. The situation is getting - well - a bit uncomfortable. To make matters worse, Rudger's influence on his ex-girlfriend Milene is greater than Jan would like. Somehow she still feels drawn to the macho and alpha animal, and so a lot has to happen before Jan can persuade her to flee. Just where? Ironically, Jan's cancer patient offers the family a refuge. The wealthy and strong-willed Dorothee consciously renounces any conventional medical treatment and wants to be treated homeopathically by Jan in her old, secluded mill in the country. She has no inkling of the situation Jan and his family are in, and so she is amazed when suddenly men of a completely different kind pay Jan a \"visit\". Suddenly it's a matter of life and death, on all fronts - and in the end the situation is damn confusing .","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA1YWMzMWMtYmQzNi00ODJlLTk3ZDUtZjM2NGQ0ZTk2OTBjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2226602/","userScore":6,"voteCount":59,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":90,"diretores":[["Stefan Krohmer","nm0471966"]],"escritores":[["Daniel Nocke","nm0633772"]],"atores":[["Devid Striesow","nm0834479"],["Corinna Kirchhoff","nm0456280"],["Joanna Kitzl","nm1073136"],["Martin Feifel","nm0270541"],["Mateo Wansing Lorrio","nm2915368"],["Aljoscha Stadelmann","nm0821113"],["Emilio De Marchi","nm0210056"],["David Bredin","nm2226348"],["Jürg Löw","nm0530562"],["Ulli Kinalzik","nm0454155"]]},{"title":"Killing Brooke","description":"On the night of her wedding, Brooke Porter finds herself pursued by a vicious psychopath, only to find her night grow worse from there.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY3NDg0NDcwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc1NDYxNjE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR10,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1808228/","userScore":5.5,"voteCount":57,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":73,"budgetUsd":5000,"diretores":[["David Zagorski","nm1920832"]],"escritores":[["David Zagorski","nm1920832"]],"atores":[["Colin Allen","nm3473588"],["Dina Baker","nm3312436"],["Kt Baldassaro","nm3539674"],["Johnny Donaldson","nm4247523"],["Alex Fandel","nm4254617"],["Ray Hryb","nm4257648"],["Martha King-Devine","nm5748103"],["Rick Martin","nm4257140"],["Chris Shanahan","nm4257551"]]},{"title":"Red City","description":"From the creative mind of Manos Cizek; A world of color and music created from the poetry of Dinos Christianopoulos and Maria Tataraki interwoven within the backdrop of a futuristic Athens, which faces modern political turmoil due to a malfunction within the android population.

The process of creating the film could be compared to creating a work of art for the reasons that the creator had full control over the production, something that rarely occurs in movie making. In the age of 3D animation, Blood Trail reverts back to the roots of animation by using a hand-drawn technique which gives the viewer a unique cinematic experience. The technical aspects of the animation add a comical element that parallel the dark humor found in the story.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2336213/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Animation","Comedy","Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":61,"diretores":[["Emerson Frakes","nm4982519"]],"escritores":[["Emerson Frakes","nm4982519"]],"atores":[["Crystal Archuleta","nm4247602"],["Jane Darling","nm5299559"],["Emerson Frakes","nm4982519"],["Christina Lafon","nm4212398"],["Patrick Sheridan","nm3114876"],["M.Q.

Upon arriving into town, Julian immediately sees peculiarities in the investigation - mainly that the local police reports omit the identity of the only man considered a suspect in the case. This man, Trent Reynolds, reveals that although he knew Wendy very little, he noticed a Paganistic scar on her arm shortly before her disappearance. This, among other clues, leads Julian to conduct research into Hoquiam's history. In doing so, he learns of an old urban legend about a Satanic cult that would abduct and sacrifice the townspeople - 'The Golden Order of the Cross.' Julian learns that not only does this cult still practice, but that its ability to control and brainwash its members proves as dangerous and deadly as the ritualistic sacrifices themselves. Risking his life and sanity, it becomes Julian's mission to infiltrate the secret cult in order to rescue Wendy, and compile enough evidence on them to initialize a police-raid.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzIxM2M4MTEtYTQ3Ni00MjNkLTgxYWMtZDRkMzVkMmQ3OWM4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,4,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2258387/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":15000,"diretores":[["Jeff Stillwell","nm4442828"]],"escritores":[["Jeff Stillwell","nm4442828"]],"atores":[["Daniel Baldwin","nm4916964"],["Mathew E.

The Hit Man, played now for the third time by Andrew Lembeck-Edens, has been staying off the grid with the hope that Officer Heading might give up the man-hunt.
