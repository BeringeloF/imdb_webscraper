Zombie Doomsday is more of an actual live scenario than a low budget independent feature film. It's a very intriguing look at what would happen if there was an actual Zombie outbreak. The concept was developed two weeks before filming and on set production was completed in under 12 hours. The actors were put in a restaurant understanding that a down on his luck movie star was coming back to his hometown to film a reality show. We then set up real events (unknown ahead of time to the actors) that would help carry the story. Some events turned out scary to them while other events were comedic.

His career was great until his books and movies started to flop. His friends and the media, especially a movie critic by the name of Henry Torres, bashed him constantly on his radio show. Domenic's divorce didn't make things any better. He was being sued for millions by his soon to be ex-wife Alicia. The only two people left that supported Domenic was Professor Khalun and his agent Eric. Domenic's fascination for the supernatural powers of ancient artifacts worried his professor. Eric tried to get Domenic back on his feet several times with little success. Over emotional and stressed, Domenic's life took a dive. Drinking and depression took its toll. Domenic wanted revenge and to recover his once lost fame. He was in no position to accomplish this, but he wondered about the legend of the supernatural powers held by a medallion recently discovered by his professor in Spain. Could it be true? Could something from the ancient time be used to strike down on those who destroyed his career? What if it was only a myth? According to the legend, the power could only be unleashed upon committing suicide. Domenic is losing his mind, but what he could unleash could give him power beyond understanding. Was he part of a more evil plan all along? What evils from the past were playing with his future? He wants revenge and everything comes with a price.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODkwMDE3NjY3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzUxODQ2NQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1956635/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Horror"],"runtimeMin":104,"budgetUsd":25000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Erik Herrera","nm3706184"]],"escritores":[["Erik Herrera","nm3706184"],["Jose Jimenez Jr.","nm4153575"]],"atores":[["Cody Cowell","nm1431341"],["Daniel G Garza","nm3225630"],["Elina Madison","nm0534965"],["Lashell Rene Alexander","nm3972997"],["Chantalle Camacho","nm4500693"],["Hsinying Hsky Chou","nm4500780"],["Mercedes Dela Cruz","nm1543129"],["Erik Herrera","nm3706184"],["Jose Jimenez Jr.","nm4153575"],["Carolina Jimenez","nm4512681"],["Santiago Jimenez","nm4512479"],["Jason Martinez Jr.","nm4519693"],["Christopher Mendoza","nm2647271"],["Jen Nikolaus","nm2946721"],["David Edward Perry","nm2840554"],["Kristina Plisko","nm3205313"],["Scott Prutch","nm4520190"],["Henry Robinson","nm4511321"]]},{"title":"Hantu Gigi","description":"A village that was once peaceful is now in turmoil due to disturbances by a ghost called Hantu Gigi.

Walter, a man so filled with shame, he deems himself unfit for society and flees deep into the wilderness hoping to escape the irreversible damage he has caused. One day, the bearded exile happens upon an abandoned campsite and decides it would be as good a place as any to make his home. Though seemingly alone, with no accusers to face, Walter finds his conscience and memories will not allow him to flee. Nor will the dark 'presence' in the woods. A traveler, named Carling, who happens upon his campsite one morning, further shatters his solitude. Despite Walter's reluctance, Carling persists in befriending the \"modern ape-man\", shrugging off his threats and misanthropy by offering gifts. Carling finds Walter to be the perfect sounding board for his unorthodox views on spiritualism and death. Although his views may seem shockingly honest and difficult to swallow, they are never malevolent. In fact, Carling seems to take pleasure in the simple things, like a good conversation, a shiny red apple, and old clichés like 'curiosity killed the cat.\" Over time, Walter's living conditions begin to take their toll on his body, as well as his state of mind. When he becomes very ill, Carling proves his friendship to Walter by making his final days as comfortable as possible. He shows him that all men are deserving of love. All they need is the willingness to accept it.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MjgxMGMtNzM1Zi00ODg5LWI0YWEtNDc3N2E0YjU5MDMwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1429011/","userScore":5.6,"voteCount":12,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Horror"],"runtimeMin":98,"budgetUsd":7000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Wolfgang Lehmkuhl","nm1959318"]],"escritores":[["Wolfgang Lehmkuhl","nm1959318"]],"atores":[["Stephen J.

He has been having a reoccurring nightmare that haunts him every night; he is being chased by a silhouetted figure through an eerie forest and no one is around to help him. Towards the end of the dream he hits a dead end and the figure attacks him just before he wakes up. During a lecture in his psychology class the next morning Tod learns more about nightmares and the kinds of psychological effects it can have on the mind, this gives him a chance to try and dissect his own personal nightmare. His best friend, Lucy (Briannah Korin), calls him and invites him over later that night to watch a movie; she has been ill with some sort of unknown sickness and has been confined to her bed for the past week. Tod agrees and later that night they end up watching a horror film involving a vampire (Will Sheffield) chasing after a young woman (Tracy Collins) outside a huge Gothic castle. Being personally terrified of vampires, the movie really gets to Tod. After leaving Lucy's house, he begins to hear and see things on his journey back home and starts to come under the impression that a real vampire is after him. From there we go inside Tod's head and see his nightmares come to life as he struggles to face and overcome his own personal fears.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmRlZTQyYjYtYjkwZi00MWFiLWExODItMzY4OGI5YjEzNWI2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1852843/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Horror"],"runtimeMin":80,"budgetUsd":10000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Stephen Wolfe","nm4142647"]],"escritores":[["Stephen Wolfe","nm4142647"]],"atores":[["Andy Palmer","nm4349398"],["Briannah Korin","nm4349210"],["Tracy Collins","nm4349027"],["Will Sheffield","nm4349741"],["Justin Herman","nm4138916"],["Jason Broussard","nm3499015"],["Mitchell Ganey","nm4349376"],["Joe Grisaffi","nm0003784"],["Scott Lee","nm4379753"],["Eric C.
