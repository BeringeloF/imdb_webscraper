The team they formed, the Gang Des Lyonnais, made them the most notorious armed robbers of the early 1970s. Their irresistible rise ended in 1974 with a spectacular arrest. Today, as he nears 60, Momon would like to forget that part of his life. He has found peace by retiring from the \"business\".

But then Serge Suttel, who has disowned nothing of his past, comes back into the picture.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU3MmMzMGEtNGYzOS00ZDM3LTlhMGItMTAyZWM5ZmMwNTlmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1741542/","userScore":6.9,"voteCount":8966,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Action","Crime","Drama","History","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":102,"revenue":10249599,"ageRating":"R","diretores":[["Olivier Marchal","nm0545356"]],"escritores":[["Olivier Marchal","nm0545356"],["Edgar Marie","nm4830242"],["Edmond Vidal","nm4800037"]],"atores":[["Gérard Lanvin","nm0487254"],["Tchéky Karyo","nm0001409"],["Daniel Duval","nm0244999"],["Lionnel Astier","nm0040005"],["Dimitri Storoge","nm1151200"],["Patrick Catalifo","nm0145880"],["François Levantal","nm0505159"],["Francis Renaud","nm0719220"],["Valeria Cavalli","nm0146848"],["Estelle Skornik","nm0804700"],["Olivier Chantreau","nm3495330"],["Stéphane Caillard","nm0128801"],["Florent Bigot de Nesles","nm1039800"],["Nicolas Gerout","nm3593928"],["Simon Astier","nm1568704"],["Laurent Richard","nm2532409"],["Olivier Rabourdin","nm0705005"],["Laurent Fernandez","nm1295999"]]},{"title":"Adam Chaplin","description":"His life was torn apart when his wife was murdered by Mafia boss Denny.

Despite his role as family accountant, Johnny is quite the marksman. He convinces a reluctant Anthony into letting him eliminate DA Elizabeth Jones.

His only contact with the world, besides his close friend PAUL are the three computer screens that blink emotionlessly at him twenty four hours a day, through sleepless nights. There, he sees the universe, filled with images of webcams around the world, from petty crimes and private confessions, to public tragedies and natural disasters. It is here, one night, as Raymond finishes piecing together an old video recording of his late wife, that he sees a mysterious woman, LAYLA. The image of her is unexpected, sexual, as she goes through a ritualistic set of gestures that leads to an emotional plea to Raymond. Alone, in an undisclosed location, she begins confessing in a sing song voice, speaking to him about her dreams, in words that echo Sarah's. As Raymond listens, he begins to realize that not only may she know the key to the death of Sarah, but that she herself may be in danger, and that it is up to him to save her before she too becomes a victim.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxODUzMzY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIxMzY5MQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893310/","userScore":7.5,"voteCount":43,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":90,"diretores":[["John W.

Now sitting in jail, for a crime that unfolds throughout the film, his story of immigration is seen through the eyes of conflicting characters. All he has ever wanted was to live the American dream. Moving to Los Angeles, Alejandro receives a warm welcome from his Colombian community; but quickly learns that to achieve his American dream - assimilation - he must turn his back on his friends, community and disown his very culture. Coming from Bogotá, crime is everything he has always run away from. Life is hard as an immigrant in L.A. and, despite the crime ventures offered him, his pride keeps him out of trouble. Similar to Jake LaMotta in RAGING BULL, he stubbornly insists on doing it solo, moves out of the community, refuses to speak his own language and finally discards the woman who lovingly believes in him. His rigid rules and pride leave him desperately alone and with diminishing options. High and dry in a hopeless situation, he is sucked into the crime and his downfall. This disputed crime is revisited and reconstructed until we discover the truth.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDQyMDllZjAtNmIwYS00MGQ2LTg1YTMtZjZhMjgzYzg3YTIwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR10,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1007941/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":900000,"diretores":[["Haim Silberstein","nm1804568"]],"escritores":[["Haim Silberstein","nm1804568"]],"atores":[["John Savage","nm0001698"],["G.J.

Marcus the leader of the group delegates while his ditsy girlfriend Carrie plays with her hair. Jade looks on disinterested while Troy tests out the camera and focuses on Jade's back dimples. Two cars set out for a remote fishing village in Toco where rampant disappearances have stained the village for decades. They hear hilarious stories from drunken locals and then head off for their beach house. They get lost and stop to ask a local villager, Lil Caesar for directions. While pulling up to the estate they meet up with Marcus' best friend Benjy. Jade is clearly upset to see her ex-boyfriend. Marcus sets up a surveillance camera in the house to safeguard their lives and the expensive video equipment. That night some supposedly harmless games leave Jade feeling more vulnerable. While everyone is asleep the camera captures Jade sleep walking while a light flashes outside the beach house The next morning Marcus sets up another camera outside the house while Troy uses the voyeuristic lens of his camera to make mischief. They take the debauchery to the beach. There Jade sees Lil Caesar who ironically lives on the same property with his father Set and two brothers Ray and Abraham. Jade openly flirts with Lil Caeser in front of Benjy and they walk off along a path that runs parallel to the beach. Lil Caeser grabs Jade's camera and records her; at his request she begins to strip for him. He tells her to turn around and close her eyes. Jade asks if he has condoms and Caesar simply laughs and buries his teeth into her neck. He overpowers her and sinks his teeth into her inner thigh. Everyone is startled when they hear Jade's screams. Troy records as Marcus and Benjy run off in the direction of the screams. A fight ensues leaving Lil Caesar face down in the frothy water. Carrie helps Jade as they assemble at the house to figure out their next move. Back at the house Candice applies rubbing alcohol to the bloody \"hiccie\" on Jade's neck and inner thigh. Troy notices Abraham coming up the track from the beach holding Lil Caesar. They prepare to leave. As they run to the vehicle it is already too late. They look on in horror as Set, Abraham and Ray begin running towards the house cutlass shining in the afternoon sun. Marcus, makes his way back inside the house, Candice runs into the SUV, Benjy and Troy run off in separate directions. Ray and Abraham make Benjy and Troy kneel as Set paces. Benjy's insolence unsettles Set and he sends for a cigar and a can of kerosene. Everyone looks on as Benjy is doused in kerosene. In true anticlimax the lighter refuses to spark so Ray and Abraham turn their cutlasses on him. Candice records the entire horrific incident from inside the SUV. Set carves into Troy's chest forcing Marcus to forsake his own safety and run to Troy's aid. Set is lenient and spares them both. Marcus helps troy back into the house. Set torments them as he offers them lunch and a sense of false hope. With their backs turned to her, Candice uses the opportunity to flee the SUV and she runs into a forested area. Set leaves his prey and to Marcus' dismay he walks off in Candice's direction. Marcus makes a run for it leaving the door open, allowing Abraham to have some harmless fun with Carrie and Troy. He leaves with a grin as he sees signs of Jade's imminent transformation taking shape. Candice comes upon a house and enters it in hopes of finding a landline. She stumbles in the darkness and comes face to face with Lil Caesar's dead body lying on a coffee table. Set walks in and Candice hides in the kitchen as he takes a piss. He then walks into the kitchen and senses her presence. He searches for her while she cowers under the kitchen sink. He finds her and she runs straight into Ray. Her camera drops from her hand and Ray picks it up. They chase after her and Candice jumps onto a small stone bench. 100 feet below the waves crash against jagged rocks. Set sadistically torments her, while she warns them to keep their distance. Set smiles and continues to approach her. Marcus runs in to save his sister but he is easily subdued by Ray. They use Marcus as bait to coax her into descending. Candice closes her eyes as she steps backwards plummeting to her death on the rocks below. Marcus is dragged back to their house and is brutally tortured. Hours pass and Carrie and Troy pace around the room. Jade gets increasingly worse as she vomits incessantly. A distraught Troy blames Marcus for bringing them to this God forsaken place. Troy's monologue is interrupted by Marcus' faint call at the door. Carrie opens the door and he collapses in her arms. They share an intimate moment. Troy observes their attackers waiting nearby as the sun dips behind the mountains. Lil Caesar, a bit stiff and pale joins his brothers and father as they stand around the house. Troy looks on in horror as they turn into balls of flames. The balls of flames fly into the air as they emit a high pitched squeal. Troy helps Marcus up and they make a last ditched run for it. Troy runs back into the house for Jade but she lunges at him sinking her teeth into his neck. Troy falls to the ground and Jade walks out of the room.
