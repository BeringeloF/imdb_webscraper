Surprised by an unexpected witness, robbers murder a woman who curses them. Little do they know of her connection with a treacherous sect indeed. Their chosen location to hide the loot turns out to be an adventure lodge where the owners are offered a talisman that supposedly grants wishes. Naively, they wish for a sum of money. Next day their beloved son unexpectedly dies. The exact sum they wished for is offered in accident insurance. Coincidence, or fate? The event lures the couple into a downward spiral. Meanwhile, the robbers are drawn to members of the sect who succeed in seducing and hideously murdering two of them, but one escapes. The owner comes upon the loot. It is again the exact same amount that he has rejected from the insurance company. Now convinced of the power of this amulet and incapable of escaping the consequences of their wish, the mother, gone mad, forces her husband to make a final wish: to bring their son back to life. The film ends with a bleak twist of the plot where the surviving thief, the owners and the undead son, all in the grip of black magic and the powerful talisman collide in a horrifying lesson that proves the dictum: Be careful what you wish for: you may just get it.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NTkzNDU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEzODE2Mw@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Donde duerme el horror","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666300/","userScore":5.3,"voteCount":62,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Horror"],"runtimeMin":91,"budgetUsd":828000,"ageRating":"R","diretores":[["Adrian Garcia Bogliano","nm0305563"],["Ramiro Garc√≠a Bogliano","nm0305564"]],"escritores":[["Carlos Castro","nm3934672"],["Adrian Garcia Bogliano","nm0305563"],["Ramiro Garc√≠a Bogliano","nm0305564"]],"atores":[["Mar√≠a Orozco","nm3931354"],["David Rivera Vargas","nm15497232"],["Michael Dionisio Morales","nm3651147"],["Jos√© Castro","nm3935350"],["Rosibel Carvajal","nm3934836"],["Silvia Campos","nm3110484"],["Est√≠baliz Sol√≠s","nm3935330"],["Ricardo Rodriguez Otoya","nm3110032"],["Jos√© Arceyuth","nm3935088"],["Roc√≠o Carranza","nm0139984"],["Mar√≠a Luisa Garita","nm3935379"],["Haymo Heyder","nm0382187"],["Claudio Morris","nm3949325"],["David Nisson","nm3956600"],["Gustavo Rojas","nm0737799"],["Rosita Soto","nm3956098"],["Sof√≠a Valverde","nm3949321"]]},{"title":"VigasioSexploitation Vol.1","description":"An egg from outer space infects the villagers of Vigasio.

Every five minutes, a transplant candidate dies while waiting for a compatible heart, a liver, a kidney. Imagine a technology that could provide those life-saving transplant organs for a nominal fee ... and imagine what a company would do to monopolize that technology. On a remote island in the Canadian Arctic, PJ Colding leads a group of geneticists who have discovered this holy grail of medicine. By reverse-engineering thousands of animal genomes, Colding's team has dialed back the evolutionary clock and re-created the progenitor of all mammals. The method? Illegal. The result? A computer-engineered living creature, an animal whose organs can be implanted in any person, with no chance of transplant rejection. There's just one problem: these ancestors are not the docile herd animals that Colding's team envisioned. Instead, the work has given birth to something big, something evil ... something very, very hungry. As creators become prey in an ultimate battle for survival, Colding and the woman he loves must fight to survive - even as government agents close in to shut the project down, and the deep-pocketed company backing this research reveals its own cold-blooded agenda.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzA0NTE2NDMtNTk0OC00NGUyLWJkYjgtMmU5ZmZkZWFjYzNlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1786388/","userScore":9.3,"voteCount":24,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Short","Horror"],"runtimeMin":2,"budgetUsd":5000,"diretores":[["Aaron Proctor","nm0698356"]],"escritores":[["Scott Sigler","nm2672602"]],"atores":[["Matt Hish","nm2399871"],["Scott Sigler","nm2672602"],["Montgomery Paulsen","nm3449832"],["Jacob Holman","nm4204298"],["Dana Kiley Buchanan","nm1822749"],["Whitney Ullom","nm3780455"],["Nolan Mecham","nm0575309"],["Keith Andreen","nm1113325"]]},{"title":"Plaster Rock","description":"Four young men and women are boated into a hunting lodge in the wilds of northern New Brunswick, Canada to partake in a cross country ski race in which the winner will reap a cash prize of $250,000.
