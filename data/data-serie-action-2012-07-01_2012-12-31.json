However, after Max is found dead in mysterious circumstances, Jonathan decides to make the trip alone, never suspecting that he will find himself caught up in an international web of intrigue. While Swiss Detective Hervé Dumaz (Clemens Schick) investigates Max Bohm's murky past, Jonathan is forced to confront his own troubled history. He uncovers a trail of grisly murders travelling through Bulgaria, Turkey, the Middle East, and the Congo, along the pathway of the migrating storks and their deadly secret.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcwYjUwMjMtMzZiOS00ODI4LWI1YjEtNGEzZDJmMzI0NzY1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1928328/","userScore":5.2,"voteCount":348,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Action","Crime","Mystery"],"runtimeMin":180,"ageRating":"Not Rated","seasons":1,"episodes":2,"atores":[["Harry Treadaway","nm2016685"],["Clemens Schick","nm0771332"],["Perdita Weeks","nm0917347"],["Rutger Hauer","nm0000442"],["Amr Waked","nm0906756"],["Danny Keogh","nm0449044"],["Carel Nel","nm3317649"],["Grant Swanby","nm0841652"],["Richard Lukunku","nm3827844"],["Antoine Basler","nm0059971"],["Scott Sparrow","nm3247514"],["Andre Jacobs","nm0414325"],["Deon Lotz","nm1824509"],["Jan Kounen","nm0468007"],["Sylvaine Strike","nm0834501"],["Graham Clarke","nm0163984"],["Matthew Dylan Roberts","nm1931355"],["Jennifer Steyn","nm0829935"]]},{"serie":true,"title":"Inferno Cop","description":"A cop with a skeleton head towards evil around the world","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI5YTExZjAtNmUwYS00Mzg5LThkNDktZjI3OWM5ZjJjMjc5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498252/","userScore":6.5,"voteCount":642,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Animation","Action","Comedy","Crime","Fantasy"],"runtimeMin":null,"ageRating":"TV-MA","seasons":1,"episodes":13,"atores":[["Junichi Goto","nm3191733"],["Yuya Hayashi","nm11112752"],["Ren Shimorenjaku","nm11112753"],["Kaname Shimorenjaku","nm11112754"],["Fumihiko Morohashi","nm2598416"],["Natsuki Wada","nm5356651"]]},{"serie":true,"title":"Achter gesloten deuren","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3OTA0NTU1ODJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ2NjAwNjg@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2432464/","userScore":5.1,"voteCount":65,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Action","Drama","Reality-TV"],"runtimeMin":null,"seasons":4,"episodes":135,"atores":[["Tom Traets","nm6743816"],["Nadine Kamer","nm4273404"],["Sem Tigchelaar","nm5975107"],["Maaike Bakker","nm4518977"],["Tara Hetharia","nm2814067"],["Udo Klompenhouwer","nm8791093"],["Pieternel Bollmann","nm7301248"],["Anoek van Korlaar","nm4272609"],["Ylva van Putten","nm5150709"],["Gaby van Nimwegen","nm11970713"],["Patrick Meijer","nm11970658"],["Nico van den Bergh","nm4811708"],["Lisa Zweerman","nm4313760"],["Arian Foppen","nm3700984"],["Leonie Bijlsma","nm3889025"],["Laurens de Groot","nm3440812"],["Cynthia de Graaff","nm0333165"],["Annemarie Hagenaars","nm2703710"]]},{"serie":true,"title":"Made in Cartagena","description":"Harvey, the leader of a powerful gang, loses his son during a robbery at a major bank.

Lao Ngow was jealous and wanted to get rid of Jao Sua Leng by sending Duangkae to be Jao Sua's lover so she can spy for him. During the banquet a group of hitmen invaded and shot many people there dead including Jao Sua's wife and his kid (s). Jao Sua narrowly escaped death with the help of Praosaeng, a waitress there. She took care of him and the two felt in love resulting in her pregnancy. The hitmen caught up with the two, in fear of his wife and child's safety Jao Sua arranged for them to escape before him. He bestowed upon his unborn child a red dragon jade, the family treasure and vowed to come back to get them after he deal with the bad guys. But Praosaeng wasn't able to escape the hitmen who came after her. Jao Sua was able to escape death this time because of Duangkae, his mistress. Lao Ngow was served with the allegation of trying to assassinate Jao Sua and was sentenced to life in prison. Daungkae backstabbed Lao Ngow because she wanted Manop, her 5 years old son with him to become the heir Jao Sua's fortune despite the fact that Manop is not Jao Sua's real son. Twenty years later, Yok, a young man with a bright future will soon graduate from the Royal Police Cadet Academy despite being an orphan and living in the slum. He was raised by an ex-boxer who now opened a school that teaches boxing to young kids. He told Yok that he discovered Yok's mother who was injured and decided to help her. He was able to save her until she passed away after giving birth to Yok. She refused to tell him the father of the baby, with only the red dragon jade by her side he named the baby, Yok.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1YmM4NzgtZmIxNS00YTU1LWEyOGItMjZkOTc5NmViYjg1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22754772/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Action","Drama","Romance"],"runtimeMin":null,"seasons":1,"episodes":22,"atores":[["Pechaya Wattanamontri","nm7346599"],["Saran Sirilak","nm13116664"],["Ruangsak Loychusak","nm5036443"],["Pimpan Chalaikupp","nm1504684"],["Kitkong Khamkrith","nm9624671"],["Nuttawat Plengsiriwat","nm2724889"],["Atirutt Singhaaumpol","nm13843614"],["Ausadaporn Siriwattanakul","nm4679888"],["Pichayadon Peungphan","nm13841430"],["Duangdao Jarujinda","nm4319405"],["Surawut Maikun","nm13803229"],["Kanyarat Pongkumpanart","nm13843615"]]},{"serie":true,"title":"Capes: The Series","description":"A normal day in the life of our heroes, Balding Man and Slush rescue two children from peril.
