This young woman asks Jiro to help her track down a lost Rolex watch that she says was accidentally thrown out of a helicopter while she was scattering the ashes of her late father.

A funny, simple and focused tale that does not pretend to be more than it is, this movie delivers.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBiNDlkMGItOTJhNi00Y2ZlLTg4YWYtZDZkM2ZmNTU1Njc2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR2,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Ma nije on takav","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1114710/","userScore":6.2,"voteCount":509,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":110,"budgetUsd":150000,"revenue":62358,"diretores":[["Miroslav Petkovic","nm2794693"]],"escritores":[["Miroslav Petkovic","nm2794693"]],"atores":[["Dragan Bjelogrlic","nm0081449"],["Gordan Kicic","nm0452190"],["Zoran Cvijanovic","nm0194143"],["Branka Pujic","nm0700234"],["Iskra Brajovic","nm2792406"],["Aleksandra Simic","nm0799499"],["Neda Arneric","nm0036208"],["Tihomir Arsic","nm0037565"],["Bojan Dimitrijevic","nm0227334"],["Nikola Djuricko","nm0229314"],["Marko Janjic","nm1711568"],["Ranko Kovacevic","nm0468186"],["Toma Kuruzovic","nm0476105"],["Branislav Lalevic","nm1191885"],["Ivana Mihic","nm0586236"],["Mina Nenadovic","nm2115778"],["Jovan Osmajlic","nm0645298"],["Milena Predic","nm2131102"]]},{"title":"The Unforgiving","description":"Two survivors, who appear unwilling to answer questions, are the only links authorities have to a spate of attacks that have hit rural South Africa.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1NDU1NDQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDcyMzc4Mw@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1717229/","userScore":3.5,"voteCount":677,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":75,"budgetUsd":5000,"revenue":16743,"diretores":[["Alastair Orr","nm3598892"]],"escritores":[["Alastair Orr","nm3598892"]],"atores":[["Ryan Macquet","nm2527839"],["Claire Opperman","nm4052349"],["Michael Thompson","nm4051277"],["Craig Hawks","nm3093375"]]},{"title":"Byomkesh Bakshi","description":"Byomkesh Bakshi is a Bengali detective who is called on for a spine-chilling case with his assistant/friend Ajit.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGI2Yzg4NWQtYjgzYy00OTBhLTgwNTAtNzlhMzNlZmRkYzNiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723596/","userScore":7.4,"voteCount":1127,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":136,"diretores":[["Anjan Dutt","nm0244864"]],"escritores":[["Saradindu Bandopadhyay","nm0051779"],["Anjan Dutt","nm0244864"]],"atores":[["Abir Chatterjee","nm3374672"],["Saswata Chatterjee","nm1384413"],["Arindol Bagchi","nm3519074"],["Dhrubajyoti Bhowmick","nm4984895"],["Biswajit Chakraborty","nm2270922"],["Pradeep Chakraborty","nm1393288"],["Ushasie Chakraborty","nm3403776"],["Kalyan Chatterjee","nm0159537"],["Phalguni Chatterjee","nm2160929"],["Pijush Ganguly","nm1385118"],["Rudranil Ghosh","nm2754475"],["Ramen Maity","nm4984874"],["Swagata Mukherjee","nm4425941"],["Swastika Mukherjee","nm3054665"],["Ratan Sarkar","nm4984884"],["Chandan Sen","nm1249087"],["Raj Srivastav","nm14322265"]]},{"title":"Lady Tiger","description":"Elektra is possessive of her father and tries to break his marriage with her mother.

The Sanskrit definitions describe it to mean that this is Age of Iron, of machines, of evil. It is said that mankind will have reached the depths of the Kali-Yuga when man starts eating man, when cows give blood and kill instead of giving milk and life. If Dharma, that is righteousness and honor, stood on four legs in the Golden Age, the Iron Age will have Dharma hobbling on one leg and gasping for breath. In 1989, Six year old Padma's father was murdered by a Brahmin, a priest who should have represented the studying of divinity, and was instead a drug peddler who used his status for greed. Now in 2008, Padma lives alone in the quiet and picturesque town of Shamrock in Belle County. The town is home to some deadly murders, with evidence of cannibalism and torture. Shamrock is also suffering from an unnatural outbreak of the deadly Mad Cow Disease. A lot of the beef and cattle in the town is infected with it and people are dropping like flies. Padma is now a 23 year old pre-med student. She is devastated, sad and most importantly, alone. Two months ago, a heart attack took her mother away from her and left Padma with nothing but herself, her thoughts, her memories and her diary. Even her good friend, Raj, is unable to bring her out of her despair despite his best efforts or his open love for her. One day, Padma gets an international call from Sumati, a woman who proclaims herself to be Padma's mothers best friend. Apparently she'd occasionally been in touch with Padma's mom all these years and had now heard of her best friend's death. She was going to come visit Padma with her son, Dev. After their arrival, Sumati has to run to New York on urgent work for her non-profit corporation, Padma is left with Dev alone for a few days. Dev, an ardent devotee of the Trimurti- Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva is deep in his understanding of spirituality and has something that Padma has aspired to all her life but could never find, he is at peace. Inspite of her desire for understanding and for happiness, Padma refuses to buy into Dev's philosophies of life. She refuses to believe in bhagwan, god, and is unrepentant for it. Her mind questions the idea of god because she is now left with no family, her father was murdered by a man of god and the deep sadness within her refuses to comprehend any sense of rationalization. She simply cannot compromise herself to believe that there is a god. She is stubborn in her belief until Dev starts behaving in a strange manner. He tells her about having dreams of Padma's life before they met. He guesses songs on the radio before they come on and he talks of having strength by devotion. He is abnormal in his abilities and credits that to his tapasya, hundreds of hours of meditation with the word \"OM\" on his lips. As a woman of science, Padma tries to make sense of his abilities. These attempts also exist because of her feelings for Dev, she is slowly falling in love with him but doesn't want to lose herself, She tries to convince herself with explanations of a myriad of possibilities like steroids, drugs, possible telepathy or just plain old trickery, maybe it was just a practical joke that Dev was playing on her. Her explanations in her diary suffice until Dev's actions become stranger, they become stronger, they cross boundaries that just seem impossible. Padma is now torn between her despair, the murder of her father, her beliefs in science, her love for Dev and her aversion to Dev's devotion to bhagwan. The love shared between Dev and Padma, her friendship with Raj, the murders and disease in Shamrock and the sadness of Padma's past all collide together in a way that she never thought possible. Will she believe?","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTRhYjAzZmYtNzUxYS00MjVlLTkyNzQtYzU3Y2Q5ZWEyMThiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR116,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1415274/","userScore":7,"voteCount":134,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":800000,"ageRating":"R","diretores":[["Adivi Sesh","nm3414188"]],"escritores":[["Adivi Sesh","nm3414188"]],"atores":[["Adivi Sesh","nm3414188"],["Jade Tailor","nm2466188"],["Sher Ali","nm2757838"],["Veronica Valencia","nm3322823"],["John Crosthwaite","nm1795058"],["Alexandra Frankel","nm3440973"],["Quint Gabriel","nm3094321"],["A.

After four atomic holocausts and the second Ice Age, only one city remains on our ravaged planet - a city on the edge of insanity, overrun by mutants and madmen, and largely controlled by the tyrannical Devoz Corporation. This dying metropolis is mired in the throes of a power struggle amongst the city's final three corporate dynasties. The surviving corporation must in the end turn to a tribe of Amazon warrior women it once tried to destroy to save their dying planet. Visionary director Daniel E. Falicki guides you through a world of lesbian warriors, insufferable Grugs, a vicious Spider Queen, and a Blue Genie with loads of \"smokable\" fun! Are YOU ready to party like it's the year 30,000? Then take a trip to FUTURE WORLD! A cutting edge rotoscoped feature in the style of Ralph Bakshi's \"Heavy Metal,\" \"Future World: City of Mass Destruction\" is sure to become a cult classic.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MDkzMDE0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA2NDE0MzE@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,6,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764329/","userScore":2.5,"voteCount":133,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Animation","Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":127,"budgetUsd":2000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Daniel Falicki","nm3048607"]],"escritores":[["Matt Simpson Siegel","nm4158884"],["Juliet Bennett Rylah","nm3833896"],["Randy Wyatt","nm4161131"]],"atores":[["Rachel Finan","nm1157283"],["Jacqueline Joy","nm4164710"],["Michael O'Hair","nm3848313"],["Joseph Scott Anthony","nm3776171"],["Cassie Truskowski","nm3068852"],["Matt Simpson Siegel","nm4158884"],["Joseph McIntosh","nm4165318"],["Marci Stembol","nm0826435"],["Marco Riolo","nm4164559"],["Jay Harnish","nm0363689"],["Josh Dunigan","nm4165113"],["Stephen Anthony Grey","nm3135178"],["Ruthie Paulson Gomez","nm4165079"],["Nano Paulson","nm4164765"],["Doug Bowman","nm4164764"],["Juliet Bennett Rylah","nm3833896"],["Joshua Lieske","nm4139896"],["Joel Potrykus","nm1811127"]]},{"title":"Igla Remix","description":"Moro returns to his native Alma-Ata for the money debt of the swindler Spartak and stays with his girlfriend, whom he parted for a long time.

Kidnapped at the age of eleven by her serial killer father, Professor David Larson, and taken on a three week Odyssey of murder and savagery before being abandon in the desert, physically unharmed, but left to carry her emotional scars into adulthood, one terrible fact forever burns in Ari's mind; her father has never been captured. Ari's book, \"Daddy's Girl\", became a New York Times best seller, and her bizarrely beautiful photography garnered her national attention before the age of twenty. But her past was a weight too heavy to bare, and fame only made it worse. So, without a word, she vanished. Now, the beautiful young woman with the haunted past has returned home (to the same house where her father brutally murdered her mother), hoping to lead something resembling a normal life. But the news media is unwilling to leave her to it. She agrees to do an interview with famed Tabloid TV personality Tandi Lewis, in an effort to dispel rumors that she has become a drugged out lunatic. Ari wants to return to her photography (now somewhat less disturbing), and hopes the interview will help show the art world she's ready to get back to work. But Tandi is only interested in Ari's past, and the interview takes on a gruesome edge, edited to make Ari appear completely insane. Then, a new nightmare enters Ari's world. After the interview airs on national TV, young women begin turning up dead in Ari's little town. The killer's MO: exactly the same as Ari's father's had been years before. Is there a copycat on the loose? Has Professor Larsen returned to resume his reign of terror? Or is Ari really the lunatic that Tandi Lewis has made her out to be? These are questions Ari herself seems incapable of answering in her own mind, as her dreams find her not only a witness to these horrible crimes (as she had been as a child), but with reoccurring images of her own hand holding the bloody knife.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNDY2MzU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcwNDM5NQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR2,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1508676/","userScore":5.9,"voteCount":57,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Stephen Savage","nm1623629"]],"escritores":[["Bob Hasse","nm3004178"],["Stephen Savage","nm1623629"]],"atores":[["Wolfgang Bodison","nm0090981"],["Will Wallace","nm0003930"],["Kyrie Maezumi","nm1836884"],["Carson Aune","nm2827409"],["Conor O'Farrell","nm0640970"],["Oscar Torre","nm0868782"],["Cazzy Golomb","nm1846773"],["Christopher Pennock","nm0672214"],["Francesca Brown","nm2885623"],["Francesca Brown","nm9808986"],["Alisa Schulz","nm1469003"],["Kristina Grindle","nm3074616"],["Kimmarie Johnson","nm0425565"],["Michael Alspaugh","nm2753176"],["Sarah Ashley","nm3120060"],["Sarah Ashley","nm3603836"],["Joshua Cieszynski","nm3595963"],["Andrea Cunningham","nm3312990"]]},{"title":"Angry","description":"When Realtor Sandra visits a foreclosed property with her client, the former owner Danny attacks them.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0NjA4MzUxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA1NDAxMDE@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1700415/","userScore":6.3,"voteCount":106,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Action","Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":85,"budgetUsd":750000,"diretores":[["Yohanna Idha","nm1779355"],["Christopher Schönning","nm1245560"]],"escritores":[["Jesper Pingo Lindström","nm1360135"]],"atores":[["Yohanna Idha","nm1779355"],["Christopher Schönning","nm1245560"],["Bo Svenson","nm0004149"],["Laurene Suralta","nm4006657"],["Ryan Garrison","nm4018339"],["David Johansson","nm4208398"],["Andreas Tinnerholm","nm2899990"]]},{"title":"Best College Days (2010)","description":"The lives of a group of young medical students take a sudden turn when one of them kills Rohit, a classmate, and the entire event gets recorded on camera.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDhiY2Y1ZmMtZWRjNy00MzNiLWJjNWEtNjZhZGZhZTE0ODgxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR115,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"College Days","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8202710/","userScore":5.2,"voteCount":43,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Jiyen Krishnakumar","nm8192059"]],"escritores":[["Jiyen Krishnakumar","nm8192059"]],"atores":[["Indrajith Sukumaran","nm1011348"],["Bhama","nm2778406"],["Biju Menon","nm0579756"],["Dhanya Mary Varghese","nm3397712"],["Sandhya","nm1886166"],["Govind Padmasoorya","nm3286607"],["Jagathy Sreekumar","nm0415549"],["Suraj Venjaramoodu","nm2241427"],["Saikumar","nm0756533"],["Venu Nagavalli","nm1964412"],["Priiya Nair","nm9166035"]]},{"title":"Help of God","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwOTAwZWItZDcxNi00NGZhLTk5MTgtYjNkMDZjMjE2ZDE3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR7,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Kamisama herupu!","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1653881/","userScore":6,"voteCount":11,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":87,"diretores":[["Shota Sasaki","nm3129740"]],"escritores":[["Ichiro Anabuki","nm4520243"]],"atores":[["Kazuki Katô","nm2411493"],["Aimi Satsukawa","nm1898396"],["Kento Kaku","nm3002430"],["Takahiro Hôjô","nm2390655"],["Takahiko Yanagisawa","nm1328881"],["Takuya Uehara","nm2204414"],["Megumi Satô","nm1935082"],["Ryosei Konishi","nm2079032"],["Satoshi Matsuda","nm1118956"],["Midoriko Kimura","nm1242935"],["Jirô Satô","nm1187057"]]},{"title":"Stricken","description":"After her mother's death and her father's brutal suicide, 25 year old Sarah Black fears she is losing her grip on reality.

To this brave new generation-and for Truman, Weasel and Doug in particular-the video camera is king. From arguments to pranks to death-defying stunts, they record it all. Even the sexual conquests of the group's alpha male, Truman, become little more than fodder for the video camera. Then Truman's sexual advances are rebuffed by a girl he had considered easy prey: a shy teenager named April, who genuinely likes Truman but isn't ready to take it to the next level. Truman strong-arms the others into accepting a wager: either he convinces April to have sex with him or he owes them each a hundred bucks. With his reputation on the line, Truman decides to pull out all the stops. He invites April to a mountain cabin for a romantic getaway. April naively agrees, unaware that Weasel has hidden himself in the cabin with a video camera. She is also unaware that, over the next few gruesome, horrifying hours, both she and Weasel will be presented with a terrifying realization: this time, Truman has no intention whatsoever of taking \"no\" for an answer.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU4MDc2MzA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA0MzY3Mw@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR6,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1339203/","userScore":6.8,"voteCount":25,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":89,"budgetUsd":150000,"diretores":[["Tod Lancaster","nm1780179"]],"escritores":[["Tod Lancaster","nm1780179"]],"atores":[["Matthew Prater","nm1056990"],["Eric Fagundes","nm2031914"],["Rachel Seiferth","nm2277184"],["Darius Safavi","nm0755809"],["Lindsay Bellock Lieber","nm2020971"],["Bobbi Jean Basche","nm1522356"],["Marie Westbrook","nm1996362"],["Elaine Loh","nm2063335"],["Meghan Ashley","nm1978091"],["Robert Donald Lee","nm3251431"],["Mark Drum","nm3251033"],["Christopher Hernandez","nm3253922"],["Veronica Kelly","nm2111746"],["Katie Kocis","nm1836870"],["Monique La Barr","nm2063753"],["Savannah Lancaster","nm3198479"],["Laura Love","nm3028600"],["Chris McWilliams","nm3237851"]]},{"title":"Enemy at the Dead End","description":"A post-traumatic stress disorder patient bounded to his bed, finds himself sharing his room with a gang looking paralyzed amnesia patient.

After having admitted his guilt and serving his sentence, he's being picked up outside the prison yard by his probably faithful wife for a long-awaited reunion. Unfortunately, in the following weeks, reality sets in when his felony record makes his repeated attempts to rejoin the workforce humbling and futile. His most recent job interview results in his bending his elbow at a watering hole. Too much to drink and an errant suspicious pill causes our disappointed husband and father to seek advice from a soothsayer who runs a weird little shop a few doors down from the bar. Under the influence and under the gun, a deal is struck in the fortune teller's lair which proves to be \"too good to be true\"? As if a beaded curtain has been parted, Jonas' life immediately turns around. Job offers. Money. Luxurious home and cars. Happiness. Family times. Until the bill is due. And who comes to collect? The most vile, hellish, repugnant demon who was ever vomited from --- well, another place and time. The Entity has all the tools to wreck all she sees. To ingest all that's good and discharge pure evil. Will Jonas have to pay the piper? A cold, grinning evil collects, with certainty - both his wife and son! A broken man, Jonas Littleton divests himself of every remnant of wealth and possession. He uses the proceeds to follow his heart and soul's remaining task. His course is clear - he must track down the Entity and extract his revenge - or die trying. Now he runs Paranormal Investigations Incorporated to soothe his damaged soul and feed his obsession. He sees the Entity in every investigation in reality or maybe not. His sanity hinges on the pursuit. Continuing his quest for revenge, he leads his investigation team from haunting to haunting, until one day he comes face to face with the Entity. How this final confrontation between a wounded-spirit human and the very essence of conniving, grinning evil plays out will knock your socks off! Twists and turns abound. You'll not believe your eyes.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEwZDA1MzctY2FkMC00NzkzLTkwZDUtMzZmN2M5ODE4YmJkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR6,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1563121/","userScore":4,"voteCount":56,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":91,"budgetUsd":100000,"diretores":[["Charles Peterson","nm0677064"]],"escritores":[["David C.

Things that threaten her life are nothing but her growing fears lurking behind. Everything she knows is about to change, all thanks to her conscience. Through this lifelike account, we see this spoiled and dull girl evolve into a more appreciative, humble, and mature woman. Is what we see real? or just an evolving creation of Alex's subconscious?","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1737630/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":98,"diretores":[["Colton Long","nm4110210"],["Nikki McKay","nm0571036"]],"escritores":[["Colton Long","nm4110210"],["Nikki McKay","nm0571036"],["Brooke White","nm4113769"]],"atores":[["Daren Ackerman","nm4109485"],["Doug Cartwright","nm2093904"],["Chelsea Guinn","nm4113532"],["Kathy Teyler Jarrett","nm4111276"],["Bonnie Larson","nm3415054"],["Aerial Long","nm4113713"],["Kate Mentesana","nm4103071"],["Lisa Mentesana","nm4109533"]]},{"title":"Erik: Portrait of a Living Corpse","description":"A darkly comic retelling of Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera, from Erik the Phantom's, twisted perspective.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzYxNjgzOTMtMGY4ZS00ODBiLWE4OGItYTI0OGM1MzdhMDc3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR10,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1787064/","userScore":4.8,"voteCount":48,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":65,"budgetUsd":6000,"diretores":[["Ryan Bijan","nm4204500"]],"escritores":[["Ryan Bijan","nm4204500"],["Gaston Leroux","nm0503693"]],"atores":[["Ryan Bijan","nm4204500"],["Ben Cortez","nm4204448"],["Catherine Curtis","nm4204627"],["Matthew Ham","nm3836344"],["Autumn Hyun","nm4204623"],["Maria Consuelo Jeri","nm4204575"],["Robert Perrin","nm4204534"],["Mely Quan","nm3603764"],["Aubrey Recchia","nm4204568"],["Thomas Reeves","nm3028300"],["Edward Lucas Salazar","nm4208699"],["Elizabeth Spieckerman","nm4204698"]]},{"title":"Hotel Hollywood","description":"A wedding party checked into a Los Angeles hotel.

From Napolitano who runs the North End with the belief that every room is bugged, to Mr. Million, who is so insecure he needs constant reassurance, to a rampant gang that can't take directions from anyone, simply because they can't hear a single thing- their preferred method of communication is sign language which leaves everyone asking, just what is going on? Out of this melting pot of eccentric and dysfunctional criminals, ambitions arise and inevitably clash. With less and less up for stake, there is a sense of urgency for everyone to grab what they can and make a run for it before the underworld is shut down for good. As time runs out, attention turns to the biggest horse race which everyone knows is fixed, but just what is fixed? While everyone zeroes in on cashing out on the fixed race, they unfortunately become oblivious to the big con that is being laid out, leaving open the question of just who gets to take off with the big payday!","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MTIzOTk3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM5MTQxOA@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR7,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1668074/","userScore":5.3,"voteCount":94,"releaseYear":2010,"genres":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":98,"budgetUsd":500000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Arthur Luhn","nm2000427"]],"escritores":[["Arthur Luhn","nm2000427"]],"atores":[["Charlie Alejandro","nm3077057"],["Rudi Anna","nm4013553"],["Hilary Barraford","nm1538210"],["Charles Cafarella","nm5365848"],["Wallace F.

The two investigators find Steiger in a small town just off the autostrada leading into the city. Brooding heat buzzing over the fields. Lemon orchards as far as the eye can see. A small farm with an agriturismo sign. In the field, a lone man harvesting his crop: Amigo Steiger. When the German officers arrive, a wild shootout ensues. The organic farmer always has his gun handy. So Amigo is able to flee to Germany slightly injured, while the investigator Sauerland is taken to the hospital in Naples seriously injured. There he is operated on by Carlotta Fortunato. What Sauerland only learns later: The doctor is Amigo's mistress. Hamburg, at the same time: The publisher Alexander Bosch and his attractive wife Maxime are in big trouble. Not only is their small publishing house on the verge of bankruptcy and the planned publication of a political book causing trouble, but their adolescent son Rio is also causing problems.
