He has his own personal robot that will transform on command into anything he can think of: boxing gloves when the school bully picks a fight; a jet pack, even a translator for girl talk. Whatever Fred needs, his new best friend, a shape-changing robot named Friday can turn himself into. But Friday was not supposed to be a gift from the sky, he was supposed to belong to Fred's neighbor, secret Agent Brains, who works for the intergalactic safety organization called The Protectors. Brains disguises herself as a regular awkward girl named Braianna, while saving the world from alien invasions, escaped bug populations, Sewer Bears, and other mysteries. It sure would be easier if she had her robot, but now he only answers Fred's voice commands.

We need former UFC Heavyweight Champion and 3x King of Pancrase Bas Rutten. And luckily for us, he's happy to help on Punk Payback. Bas has surveyed hundreds of hours of footage and found the best examples of punks who have gotten away with their crimes. Along with the hottest stars of motocross, surf, and skate, Bas will reenact each scenario, demonstrating the necessary combat moves one would need to survive on the street. With Rutten's unique brand of humor and extensive fighting knowledge, he will provide an entertaining and helpful commentary as he breaks down exactly what moves and methods one should use when encountering a punk. In each episode, Bas will run through five scenarios, ranging from the deadly to the downright crazy, and each show will conclude with the \"Who's the Bas\" clip, demonstrating a civilian successfully standing up to the punks. It will be pure rock'em, sock'em fun, while providing both the catharsis and confidence we need. Watch out punks; it's time for the little guy to take charge in Punk Payback.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MTcyMzIwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA2NjAxMzE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR93,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2091019/","userScore":7.9,"voteCount":83,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Action"],"runtimeMin":null,"seasons":1,"episodes":10,"atores":[["Bas Rutten","nm1008015"],["Leo Georgallis","nm4078686"],["Natalie Quinones","nm4727687"],["Benjamin Seeger","nm4551382"],["Curta Edwards Schlarbaum","nm4774241"],["Tony Milio","nm2581734"]]},{"serie":true,"title":"Lektor","description":"Car explosion in the centre of Moscow.
