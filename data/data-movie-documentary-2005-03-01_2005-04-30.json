Over 30 credible eyewitnesses, children, scientists, military, pilots and experts give compelling testimony to the reality of these mysterious global visitations, including former AZ Gov. Fife Symington who discloses that he witnessed the event and it wasn't military! Astronaut and moon walker Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Sc.D. confirms that these phenomena are real! A Commercial & Vietnam pilot witnessed the silent, mile wide craft glide above his head. A Veteran 911 Phoenix Police operator tells all about that fateful night. NASA footage confirms that these phenomena are here. UFO buffs call it the most documented and important mass sighting ever recorded. But still today, the military and government can only offer questionable explanations as to what the anomalous lights truly were. In over 11 years, the strange phenomena have never been duplicated or re-enacted [although the military tried fruitlessly, three years later]. Many experts and witnesses insist that what appeared in the Arizona skies was something beyond this world. But there is much more to the story! What were they? How did they affect the witnesses?

Delving deep into the complex history of gang culture in Los Angeles, Bone, a member of the Athens Park Bloods, traces his roots all the way back to the 1950s when the first black gangs formed to protect themselves, into the political awakening of the '60s, through the tumultuous aftermath of the civil rights movement, and finally into the modern era of Bloods and Crips. \"Bastards of the Party\" paints a vivid picture of the interconnectedness between gang violence, systemic racism, and government policies, exposing the devastating impact all of these forces had on communities of color. Through its thought-provoking narrative, powerful imagery, and unparalleled access to modern gangs, \"Bastards of the Party\" leaves a lasting impression and profound impact, challenging audiences to confront the deep-rooted issues of inequality and injustice that plague society.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2NzUwMjI5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk1MjQxMw@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR10,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455913/","userScore":8.1,"voteCount":558,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":95,"diretores":[["Cle Sloan","nm0805944"]],"atores":[["Daryl Gates","nm0309551"],["Fred Hampton","nm0358980"],["Joe Hicks","nm2562927"],["Ericka Huggins","nm2554180"],["Rodney King","nm0455219"],["LBONGO","nm0015466"],["Cle Sloan","nm0805944"],["M.

Despite seeming like a possible blessing - sufferers cannot feel when they are burning their hands, cutting their feet, even a broken bone - so they lack that warning sign by which sudden pain alerts the rest of us to the danger, causing us to jump back, let go of a hot pan, or otherwise protect ourselves from further harm. In this way, pain actually protects us, by functioning as a very effective warning signal. For children then, especially, lacking this signal becomes extremely perilous and requires just absolute constant protection and many injuries are made worse by not alerting the child to, for example, pull their hand back from a hot stove and so on.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY1MGVlNmYtZTM4NS00YjQyLWI2ZmUtYzgzNDVmYzJmMDJmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR10,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452639/","userScore":6.9,"voteCount":125,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":73,"diretores":[["Melody Gilbert","nm1745923"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Roy Jones, Jr.: Heart of a Champion","description":"An intense inside look at three-time light-heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr. preparing for his highly anticipated rematch with Antonio Tarver.

During the 1970s Lonnie Frisbee became widely known as California's \"hippie preacher,\" the quintessential \"Jesus freak\" whose pictures frequented such magazines as Time and Life as the media told the story of a burgeoning \"Jesus movement.\" Lonnie Frisbee provided the charismatic spark that launched the Calvary Chapel church into a worldwide ministry and propelled many fledgling leaders into some of the most powerful movers and shakers of the evangelical movement. During the 1980s Lonnie was at the center of the \"signs and wonders\" movement, one that focused on reviving the practice of spiritual power through diving healing, speaking in tongues and other demonstrative manners of manifesting the power of God. But besides his influence and beyond the miraculous stories that swirl in the wake of his life, what makes the story most fascinating is that his call into the ministry came while deeply involved in the Laguna Beach homosexual scene. Treated with contempt by the ministers whom he helped establish, Lonnie has been written out of their collective histories. He died as as result of the AIDS virus in 1993.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNzI5ODgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ4MzAzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465467/","userScore":7.4,"voteCount":126,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":105,"budgetUsd":25000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["David Di Sabatino","nm1950956"]],"escritores":[["David Di Sabatino","nm1950956"]],"atores":[["Phil Aguilar","nm1954304"],["Darrell Ballman","nm1954483"],["Connie Bremer","nm1955208"],["Rich Buhler","nm1951581"],["Jon Carreon","nm1953080"],["Tommy Coomes","nm1950871"],["Ken Fish","nm1954150"],["Lonnie Frisbee","nm2046786"],["Bob Fulton","nm10063794"],["Chuck Girard","nm1952702"],["Marjoe Gortner","nm0331374"],["Kenn Gulliksen","nm1956137"],["Phil Mahlow","nm1949616"],["Sandi Mahlow","nm1952548"],["Bryan Marleaux","nm1949608"],["Mercedes Marleaux","nm1957319"],["Joe Martinez","nm1954042"],["Judy Meston","nm1957313"]]},{"title":"Champion","description":"Danny Trejo, you know the man.

Of the twenty million people in Ghana, two million are disabled. This is the story of one disabled man whose mission-and purpose- is to change all that forever. In Emmanuel's Gift, filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have uncovered a story as compelling as it is important. Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the film chronicles the life of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a young Ghanaian man born with a severely deformed right leg, who today, against incalculable odds, is opening minds, hearts and doors-and effecting social and political change throughout his country. While Emmanuel's message is vital: people with disabilities are valuable contributors to any society, his method is inspirational. Emmanuel begins his quest with a bicycle ride, over 600 kilometers, across Ghana with one leg-and continues to spread his vision with grit and resolve. Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have been documenting Emmanuel's plight for over a year, having shot over 100 hours of powerful imagery. The film includes original footage shot in Ghana, California, Oregon and New York, as well as photographs and other acquired film/video of Emmanuel's early years. Through it all, they have created an intimate insight into the mind and heart of a visionary whose unforgettable journey transcends continents and cultures and becomes each of ours to share.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1ODIwNDE0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjgyMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447016/","userScore":7.6,"voteCount":208,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":80,"revenue":23728,"ageRating":"G","diretores":[["Lisa Lax","nm1831708"],["Nancy Stern Winters","nm0827800"]],"escritores":[["Lisa Lax","nm1831708"],["Elizabeth Massie","nm0557400"],["Nancy Stern Winters","nm0827800"]],"atores":[["Robin Williams","nm0000245"],["Oprah Winfrey","nm0001856"]]},{"title":"Xena Warrior Princess: The Final Season","description":"A documentary on the final season of Xena Warrior Princess.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUxNGFjNjYtMjU0MS00N2I1LWE4YjctNzEwYTJhMTZhYTU0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR12,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479771/","userScore":8.2,"voteCount":133,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":31,"atores":[["Clyde Brown","nm2206659"],["Eric Gruendemann","nm0344408"],["Lucy Lawless","nm0005128"],["William Gregory Lee","nm0498457"],["Hudson Leick","nm0500098"],["Renée O'Connor","nm0640488"],["Ted Raimi","nm0001646"],["Rob Tapert","nm0849964"],["Alexandra Tydings","nm0878714"],["Adrienne Wilkinson","nm0929330"]]},{"title":"Vendetta Song","description":"This short documentary follows Montreal filmmaker, Eylem Kaftan, as she travels to Turkey in an attempt to unravel the 30-year-old mystery of her aunt Guzide's murder.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmI4MDA3ZDEtOGQwMy00MGM0LWJiNjAtMzM4NDFhODU3YTAyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,3,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456027/","userScore":7.3,"voteCount":163,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":45,"budgetUsd":400000,"diretores":[["Eylem Kaftan","nm1549870"]],"escritores":[["Eylem Kaftan","nm1549870"],["Irene Lilienheim Angelico","nm0029570"],["Jeremiah Hayes","nm0371067"]],"atores":[["Eylem Kaftan","nm1549870"]]},{"title":"Waging a Living","description":"The term \"working poor\" should be an oxymoron.

Often loses things. Difficulty remaining seated, playing quietly, or sustaining attention. Sound like your child? The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) lists these as the symptoms of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), or Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Once diagnosed, these behaviors would make your child a candidate for Ritalin, Prozac, or both. In this investigative documentary, acclaimed public health advocate and filmmaker Gary Null examines the increasingly common practice of prescribing psychotropic drugs for children, including preschoolers as young as age 2 to 4, who have been diagnosed with ADD, or ADHD. Psychiatrists may write these prescriptions without first exploring other causes or aggravating factors, like diet, or environment, and without making it clear to parents that these medications can have severe side-effects, including insomnia, loss of appetite, facial tics, headaches, psychotic symptoms and even potentially fatal adverse reactions, such as cardiac arrhythmia. Many schools work with family court systems to force parents to drug their children, threatening those who refuse to cooperate with the prospect of having them taken from the home and placed in foster care. To some, this looks like institutionalized child abuse in the name of mental health, whereby active, naturally inquisitive children are drugged into submission while the pharmaceutical industry prospers.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0850665/","userScore":7.4,"voteCount":70,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":104,"diretores":[["Manette Loudon","nm2367654"],["Gary Null","nm1567037"]],"escritores":[["Gary Null","nm1567037"]],"atores":[["Neil Bush","nm1778209"],["Michael Moore","nm0601619"],["Gary Null","nm1567037"]]},{"title":"All I Want: A Portrait of Rufus Wainwright","description":"A portrait of the singer as he recounts his Montreal childhood, his New York breakthrough, and his subsequent successes worldwide.

Rodolfo is able to unite its splinter groups, and enjoys a brief moment of glory, but later can't keep them together. He has a falling out with the governmental authorities who, at one point, had supported him, and ends up in jail accused, falsely according to him, of robbery. For the documentary he is interviewed in prison. The second story is that of María Fernanda Ramos Macín (Mafer), an emotionally unstable girl whose life begins to disintegrate in a mixture of partying, alcohol, drugs and unwanted pregnancies, until she attempts suicide by jumping from an 11-meter tall bridge, which leaves her paraplegic. The last story is that of Alejandro Cota, a psychopath serving a 50-year jail sentence for murdering his mother and three siblings in 1992.

Soldiers, journalists, historians and experts on combat interviewed in VOICES IN WARTIME add diverse perspectives on war's effects on soldiers, civilians and society. In VOICES IN WARTIME, poets around the world, from the United States and Colombia, to Britain and Nigeria, to Iraq and India, share their views and experiences of war that extend beyond national borders and into the depth of the human soul. The film also brings to life how poetry and war have been intertwined since the beginning of recorded history - from ancient Babylonia and the fields of Troy - to the great conflicts of the 20th century and the current war in Iraq. The stirring words of poets of the past - Homer, Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes, Walt Whitman and Shoda Shinoe from Hiroshima are combined with more recent voices: a Vietnam vet, poets in Baghdad, a poet whose family experienced the devastating war in Biafra. The poetry moves us to the emotion of war explained to us by soldiers, journalists and a doctor who have experienced the effects of combat first hand. The poetry illuminates the reality. And the documentary reality helps us to understand the poetry. Together they sear the experience, emotions and sacrifices of war into our hearts and minds. VOICES IN WARTIME gives the gut-wrenching experience of war a fresh perspective. It steps away to look at all wars - not just the conflicts currently in the news. The terrible beauty of the poetry is our guide, distilling the grim realities and divers emotions of war. History and literature have shown us that in times of war poets can lead us to greater truths and that the power of poetry can help us understand the trauma, violence and death caused by armed conflict. VOICES IN WARTIME uses the words of Wilfred Owen, considered by many to be the greatest poet of World War I, as a guide: \"Above all I am not concerned with Poetry. My subject is War, and the pity of War. The poetry is the pity...All a poet can do today is warn. That is why Poets must be truthful.\"","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MzcxNzIyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIzMTEzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,6,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443691/","userScore":6.9,"voteCount":39,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":74,"revenue":20702,"diretores":[["Rick King","nm0004488"]],"escritores":[["Rick King","nm0004488"]],"atores":[["Chris Abani","nm2039920"],["Sinan Antoon","nm1847614"],["Rachel Bentham","nm2041255"]]},{"title":"Hubble: 15 Years of Discovery","description":"Covers all aspects of the Hubble Space Telescope project - a journey through the history, the troubled early life and the ultimate scientific successes of Hubble.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNzA1MTU2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYyMDEzMg@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201062/","userScore":7.5,"voteCount":116,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":83,"budgetUsd":100000,"diretores":[["Lars Lindberg Christensen","nm2952233"]],"escritores":[["Lars Lindberg Christensen","nm2952233"],["Stuart Clark","nm2952289"],["Stefania Varano","nm2952225"]],"atores":[["Robert Fosbury","nm5595566"]]},{"title":"Case of the Sponge 'Bob'","description":"Featurette voiced by Stephen Hillenburg and Jean-Michel Cousteau, where two children want to find Bikini Bottom.

FORST is a documentary with fictitious elements about a mysterious group of outcasts in the forest. This 50-minute film was awarded the \"best short documentary prize\" at the Graz Diagonale film festival. FORST is a portrait of a forest in the middle of Europe that harbors a community of banished people, set beyond urban life and civilization - a stranded world. In FORST, the outcasts proclaim their own truth and tell the story of their empowerment. For slowly they become aware of their identities as political refugees and they begin drawing liberation plans. FORST is unsettling and leaves thousands of questions unanswered. It documents a struggle at the front line of hardened opinions, the struggle of who defines reality. The filmmakers' view confronts the audience's view by being provocative, insolent and belligerent.

But Naples also has a more complex side. Behind the splendor and pomp that dates from the time when Naples still had great political and social influence, one can also find poverty and adversity. The film director Vincent Monnikendam ends in the backstreets and steep alleyways where sunlight barely penetrates, where dark drama and frivolity keep the age-old city in their grip. The central feature of the film is the painting The Seven Acts of Mercy by Caravaggio, the master of the clair-obscur. This altar piece was painted in 1607, commissioned by the noble founders of the Pio Monte della Misericordia, a charitable institution that is still active. Myths about this painting, the history of the Pio Monte, the joy and sorrow of Neapolitans, alternate and combine to form a colourful portrait. With a leading role for the city of Naples itself. Among the important characters in Souls of Naples are Pietro Gargano, editor-in-chief of the newspaper Il Mattino and a connoisseur of urban history, and Gian Paolo Leonetti, former chairman of the Pio Monte della Misericordia and a descendant of a noble family. The baroque interior of the villa where we meet contrasts with the sober entourage of the inner city. This is where the transsexual Gianni earns a meagre income by selling lottery tickets and Pina tells us about her difficult existence while she sews trendy handbags in a small factory located in an old cellar. The Russian painter Natalia Tsarkova tries to communicate in her own work the essence of clair-obscur in the paintings by Caravaggio whom she so admires. According to her, the special lighting effects with powerful contrasts so characteristic of his work are the symbol of survival, for good and evil, for life and death. In a style inspired by these characteristic light-dark contrasts Souls of Naples provides an inspiring portrait of a city that has survived for two and half thousand years.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDExMjYwMTgtNjAwYy00ZGU4LThhYzQtNzUzNGFhNDkzZmVjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Zielen van Napels","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457535/","userScore":6.8,"voteCount":63,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":94,"revenue":10028,"diretores":[["Vincent Monnikendam","nm0598372"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"El Perro Negro: Stories from the Spanish Civil War","description":"Filmmaker Péter Forgács compiles home movies by a family of Catalan industrialists who have documented their lives as their homeland is besieged by labor unrest, the collapse of the monarchy, the rise of anarchism, and ultimately the Spanish Civil War.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBkNzQwOTEtZjdjMy00MmFiLThiYmEtNGFiMTdiY2U5NDM2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457333/","userScore":6.8,"voteCount":65,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":84,"diretores":[["Péter Forgács","nm0286282"]],"atores":[["Miklós Bodóczky","nm2074220"],["Fernando Bujarrabal","nm2075795"],["Nils Blunck","nm2087559"],["Péter Forgács","nm2727803"]]},{"title":"Windsor Castle: A Royal Year","description":"Three-part documentary series which goes behind the scenes at the Queen's favourite home, Windsor Castle.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MzA5NzQ3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUzMjIzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"The Queen's Castle","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455713/","userScore":7.7,"voteCount":116,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":180,"diretores":[["Matt Reid","nm1669041"]],"escritores":[["Robert Hardman","nm1898654"]],"atores":[["Barbara Flynn","nm0283409"],["Michael Ball","nm0050431"],["Arnaud Bamberger","nm1901431"],["King Charles III","nm0697608"],["Andrew Farquharson","nm1907934"],["Rupert Featherstone","nm1902690"],["Mark Flanagan","nm1907276"],["Christine Fry","nm2093699"],["Jordan Fry","nm1627748"],["Joshua Fry","nm2002007"],["Rachel Fry","nm2095557"],["Edward Griffiths","nm1902242"],["David Hasselhoff","nm0001327"],["Gary Jones","nm1932191"],["Sarah Kelly","nm1907409"],["Jodie Kidd","nm0452249"],["Stephen Marshall","nm1903246"],["Edward Mills","nm1899707"]]},{"title":"Madman Muntz: American Maverick","description":"Earl \"Madman\" Muntz was a well-known TV ad pitchman in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in oddball commercials for his various electronics and car businesses just after the Ed Sullivan show.

Their implications are enormous, for they reveal that Jesus was not an unsuspecting victim. Instead, He died exactly in the manner God intended. The fulfillment of prophecy authenticates that Christ was, indeed, the promised Messiah. And Jesus said, \"...all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled\" (Luke 24:44). The Prophecies of the Passion-a 58-minute documentary-explores millennia of Biblical revelation and its fulfillment through the life and death of Jesus Christ. For those who already believe in the miracle of the Christ's death and resurrection, The Prophecies of the Passion provides a new source of insight, encouragement and confirmation of faith. For those who doubt, it is a powerful apologetic argument for the veracity of the Scriptures and the life of Christ.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA1MDczOTIwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA1MDA2MDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR3,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452667/","userScore":8.1,"voteCount":26,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":58,"budgetUsd":250000,"diretores":[["Wayne P.

But, they were the first in scooping the world on the major events in Europe: the invasion of Sicily, the top story of the century - D-Day1, the liberation of Paris, the Elbe River link up of the Allied armies, the first feature documentary shot while under fire, and only footage shot of action leading to a Victoria Cross. This documentary has its own first. Viewers will see, for the first time, original colour footage of the D-Day operation. They will see clips of the unit's first production Wood for War about the Canadian Forestry Corps at work in Scotland, as well as clips from the CFPU's own newsreels, both never before seen on television. Through fresh interviews with veterans of the CFPU and its archival newsreels, viewers will see the story from the men who shot the film: Charles Roos, the first allied cameraman ashore on D-day; the late Al Calder, who parachuted over the Rhine and shot that operation; Michael Spencer, the unit's first editor, who worked on the feature documentary above; and, the late Lew Weeks, who shot the liberation of Paris. This history takes on a personal flavour through three highlights. In the first, James O'Regan relates a small detail in the Invasion of Normandy on D-Day: a despatch rider, O'Regan's father Brian (1924-1999), played a small but key role that had helped the world first learn of this mighty event from the CFPU. In the second, we see how Brian became the first Canadian to enter Dieppe after the Invasion. In the third, we see how Brian became the subject of a world scoop photo at the Elbe River Link Up between the US and Soviet armies.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcwODlmYjYtZjMxNS00ZTY0LThhMjAtMzJhNTJkYjRlZTJjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,26,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464836/","userScore":7.8,"voteCount":14,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":49,"diretores":[["James O'Regan","nm0642395"]],"escritores":[["James O'Regan","nm0642395"]],"atores":[["Al Calder","nm1949924"],["James O'Regan","nm0642395"],["Charles Roos","nm1952028"],["Michael Spencer","nm0818036"],["Lew Weeks","nm1949842"]]},{"title":"Albert II de Monaco, le prince méconnu","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4NjI4MWMtMWQ3Ny00MDNjLWJmYjUtN2NlYWEzZDVjNDk5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1573469/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":120000,"diretores":[["Thibaut Faucon","nm3734877"]],"atores":[["Prince Albert of Monaco","nm0697604"],["Lionel Richie","nm0005360"],["Simeon II of Bulgaria","nm2714469"],["Thibaut Faucon","nm3734877"],["Allen Woody","nm0941028"],["Régis Faucon","nm1914156"]]},{"title":"For Norman: Wherever You Are","description":"Actress -turned- housewife/mother, Ally Walker takes a walk in the park and meets a homeless baby, Norman and his mother.

While Argentina suffered 649 casualties during the War, subsequently over 350 ex-servicemen have committed suicide while attempting to come to terms with civilian life in the aftermath of the 1982 defeat. Longo's film is structured around an extended interview with War veteran Sergio Delgado who provides a moving testimony on the conflict and the ways in which it has subsequently haunted his life and aspirations. As much an insider's view of the conflict as a tale of the legacy of trauma, Not Really Ours offers a reflection on memory, fear and the shaping of a nation's psyche. Longo's deft editing juxtaposes telling footage alongside Delgado's story. The result is both a moving tapestry of war and its scars and a telling reflection on the ways in which official history is constructed.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM3OGIwMDAtNDE5Yy00NjJkLWE4MTctNDVmNjAyM2VlN2YwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436637/","userScore":8.7,"voteCount":19,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":74,"diretores":[["Ramiro Longo","nm1252256"]],"atores":[["Sergio Delgado","nm1668419"],["Ramiro Longo","nm1252256"],["Leonel Pazos Scioli","nm1883171"]]},{"title":"Missing, Presumed Dead: The Search for America's POWs","description":"Hundreds of American POWs from the Korean War were abandoned in N.

Moore, a Flint native, wrote and directed the documentary Roger and Me about the darker side of capitalism and General Motors. Omar McGee, another Flint native, picks up where Moore left off with Flint Town Kids, a documentary showing the African American dark side of Flint. Flint is predominantly populated by African Americans who migrated from the south after Reconstruction. Flint can be viewed as a microcosm of America's poverty stricken urban areas. Once abandoned by General Motors, Flint became one of the poorest urban areas in the country. Flint Town Kids captures the bleak setting in which these Flint natives exist. It powerfully examines the hardships, the sufferings, mishaps and sacrifices made in order to persist in this town. Flint Town Kids highlights the frightening education system in Flint where schools are designed to produce basketball players only. On the other hand, students who are non basketball players are left with mediocre excuses for classrooms while adjusting to the lack of libraries needed to empower young minds. The documentary takes a very close look at children who bare the armor of strength in trying to escape Flint. Flint's has been successful in producing a legacy of basketball players ranging from playground hopefuls to the pros. The film highlights current and former NBA players such as Morris Peterson (Toronto Raptors), Eddie Robinson (Chicago Bulls), Trent Tucker and Glen Rice as well as Tracy McGrady (Houston Rockets) LeBron James, (Cleveland Caveliers), Jason Richardson (Golden State Warriors) Chucky Atkins (Boston Celtics) and Jonathan Bender (Indiana Pacers) who have achieved the dream of making it to the pros. For those who are not as fortunate to escape the nightmarish lifestyle that Flint brings, they embark on survival methods such as drugs and violence. Flint Town Kids brings to light the little faith left in the system. Children raising kids and kids age ten killing each other is just an everyday part of life in Flint. The documentary will depict those shocking scenes in the lives of children who are left with no choice but to make adult decisions in a world where only the fittest survive. For many adults the consuming goal of overcoming poverty lies in making cocaine. Flint Town Kids graphically explores this process which seems to have become the saving grace for many in a town that presents scarce positive outcomes for the future. Flint Town Kids will leave audiences outraged and enthralled with the African American lifestyle in an area that once presented promise only miles from the Motor City.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3OTExMzUtZjVkZC00ODNlLTg3MGMtNTNmYzQ4NjNiMjhmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457348/","userScore":6.8,"voteCount":93,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":80,"budgetUsd":130000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Omar McGee","nm1899003"]],"escritores":[["Omar McGee","nm1899003"]],"atores":[["Chucky Atkins","nm1897175"],["Mateen Cleaves","nm1898627"],["Desmon Farmer","nm1889750"],["Chris Grier","nm1647049"],["Corey Hightower","nm1898316"],["LeBron James","nm1429908"],["Tracy McGrady","nm1185671"],["Morris Peterson","nm1893698"],["Jason Richardson","nm1111809"],["Jermaine Smith","nm1896972"],["Kevin Tolbert","nm1898793"]]},{"title":"The Sea Hawk: Flynn in Action","description":"Rudy Behlmer, Lincoln Hurst, John Mauceri and Robert Osborne discuss the making of The Sea Hawk (1940).","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkzYWFjYTUtYTQ0MS00OGRkLWFjNDMtNWQxOWE0NTgyNzU3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR1,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456649/","userScore":6.7,"voteCount":50,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":17,"atores":[["Lincoln Hurst","nm1822256"],["Rudy Behlmer","nm0066935"],["Robert Osborne","nm0651737"],["John Mauceri","nm0560754"],["Tim Weske","nm0921721"],["Errol Flynn","nm0001224"],["Alan Hale","nm0002118"],["Brenda Marshall","nm0550782"],["Flora Robson","nm0733460"]]},{"title":"When Metallica Ruled the World","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0492920/","userScore":8.1,"voteCount":140,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"runtimeMin":43,"diretores":[["Ben Tishler","nm1054778"]],"atores":[["Joe Berlinger","nm0075666"],["Jim Breuer","nm0108028"],["Sully Erna","nm1263394"],["Jay Jay French","nm1216477"],["Kirk Hammett","nm0004987"],["James Hetfield","nm0381723"],["Scott Ian","nm1022823"],["Chuck Klosterman","nm1796345"],["John Kornarens","nm3817710"],["Jason Newsted","nm0628447"],["Riki Rachtman","nm0705146"],["Marc Reiter","nm1341079"],["Carol Richter","nm11724809"],["Bob Rock","nm0734147"],["Brian Slagel","nm1255498"],["Tony Smith","nm0810204"],["Robert Trujillo","nm0874235"],["Jaan Uhelszki","nm4987857"]]},{"title":"Bowery Dish","description":"Bowery Dish is a one-hour video documentary that illuminates the complex issues surrounding urban renewal/gentrification on the Bowery in a provocative and entertaining fashion.

For these women who are on intimate terms with sexual abuse, poverty, and addiction, the Taconic Correctional Facility in New York State offers a rare gleam of hope. One of only five prisons in the U.S. to provide a nursery program for inmates, Taconic allows the women to keep their babies for the first 18 months of their lives while insisting that the mothers participate in a rigorous series of classes that range from basic child care to anger management and drug counseling. Each woman is released in the course of filming. Each must choose whether to find a job, break the cycle of relapse and re-arrest that has led to the loss of her other children, or pick up the crack pipe, abandon the child, and return to the streets. Shot in cinema-verité style, Prison Lullabies addresses these issues by allowing the audience the opportunity to view and listen as the stories of the inmate mothers unfold in their own time and in their own words. Prison Lullabies is an extraordinary tale - that of four women making life-altering choices and seizing the glimmer of possibility the prison nursery program is holding out for them and for the future of their children.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4MDAwMjgtNjljNS00MjMyLWI5ZjktMjlhZWRjZmQyZTIwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR7,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476001/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Odile Isralson","nm1126243"],["Lina Matta","nm2015568"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Forever in Our Hearts: The Making of Documentary","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445969/","userScore":2.4,"voteCount":86,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":250000,"diretores":[["Damon Harman","nm0363401"]],"escritores":[["Damon Harman","nm0363401"]],"atores":[["Mitch Allan","nm1502189"],["Billi Bruno","nm1035156"],["Andrew Bryniarski","nm0117420"],["John Cho","nm0158626"],["Nate Dogg","nm0230489"],["Corey Feldman","nm0000397"],["Jaime Gomez","nm0004968"],["Kelly Hu","nm0005026"],["Brian McKnight","nm0005213"],["Jason Charles Miller","nm1390709"],["Ben Moody","nm1394404"],["Mya","nm0616550"],["Devin Reeve","nm1229748"],["Eric Roberts","nm0000616"],["Roselyn Sanchez","nm0761052"],["Sonny Sandoval","nm1264567"],["Ming-Na Wen","nm0001840"],["Natashia Williams","nm0931372"]]},{"title":"Camisea","description":"From Peruvian Amazon region crossing along Andes, up to Pacific Ocean, a monumental gas pipeline is built to transport natural gas for first time to city of Lima.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455370/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":68,"diretores":[["Enrique Bellande","nm1163312"]],"escritores":[["Enrique Bellande","nm1163312"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"The Outdoorsmen: Blood, Sweat & Beers","description":"Once a year, an exclusive group of men travels to a top-secret location somewhere in the wooded mountains of Washington State to compete in an all-day event they call The Outdoorsmen.

For the past 4 years, this dedicated group has competed relentlessly to bask in the glory of winning the coveted title of Outdoorsmen Champion.

Until recently, residents would celebrate'Devil's Night' on the eve of Halloween by going out and setting fire to dilapidated buildings. Houses, factories, stores, office blocks, theatres, even the railway station, stand in ruins or have disappeared altogether, leaving vast empty lots that have returned to nature. The home of Motown music, Detroit is also the most segregated major city in the United States, and one of the poorest, struggling to provide public services for its needy inhabitants. This film looks back over the history of the city in the twentieth century: over the rise and fall of the social system identified by sociologists as 'Fordism'; the way the city was shaped by the automobile; and its decline following the deindustrialisation which began in the 1950s, leaving it ill-adapted to the post-Fordist society of the epoch of globalisation. Much of the story is told through a rich variety of archive footage - of the Ford plants, mass protests of the Depression years, Diego Rivera painting his famous mural 'Detroit Industry', the struggle for trade union rights, the riots of 1943 and 1967 - through which the film charts the battle over the image of the city and its industry that began when the Ford Motor Company started making its own films back in 1913.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZhMGMxZGMtNGY1Mi00YjI5LTg0ZjQtNDUyMjQ5ZjQyZjRmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR3,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452610/","userScore":7.6,"voteCount":14,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":92,"diretores":[["George Steinmetz","nm1874484"],["Michael Chanan","nm0151196"]],"escritores":[["Michael Chanan","nm0151196"],["George Steinmetz","nm1874484"]],"atores":[["Lowell Boileau","nm0092264"],["Dan Georgakas","nm8145377"],["Tyree Guyton","nm3042506"],["Loïc Wacquant","nm0905244"]]},{"title":"Artist of Resistance","description":"Can a village heal after the massacre of its children? A Berkeley artist journeys into the jungle of El Salvador to battle repression and obliteration with the life-affirming act of creating art. Claudia Bernardi, an internationally known artist who works in the fields of human rights and social justice, takes a journey into the guerrilla territory of El Salvador. There she joins the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team to participate in the excavation of a mass grave. Their mission is to record the truth: was it a battle between two armies, or a massacre? Rufina Amaya Marquez, mother of four and the only survivor of the massacre, insisted on justice until the United Nations Truth Commission finally ordered this investigation. The excavation begins. Slowly they uncover the bones of 131 children whose average age is 6 years old. Clearly these are not guerilla soldiers. The case is closed. But the El Salvadorian government provides amnesty for those responsible. Filled with rage, Claudia returns to Berkeley. She interprets this reality through a series of prints. She then returns to El Salvador armed with paints and brushes to paint murals with the children who had inherited this atrocity. Out of this experience emerges the role of the artist as activist. The soldiers were ordered to destroy, but Claudia and her band of small muralists create. Claudia Bernardi's own art is stunning. It is animated in moving layers throughout the film and creates a powerful global statement against violence.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5NTUwNTU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM0MDAzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,7,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455329/","userScore":8.6,"voteCount":14,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","History"],"runtimeMin":58,"budgetUsd":210000,"diretores":[["Penelope Price","nm0697091"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Dirt: A Season Inside the Devil's Bowl","description":"\"This is real. It's blood, sweat, tears, mud, dirt, beer.\" -- Travis Pace, #17. DIRT, a documentary by Jeff Bowden, follows a season inside the soul of American auto racing-the World Class Street Stocks-at the legendary Devil's Bowl Speedway, in Mesquite, Texas, as the racers careen on and off the track toward the season championship. \"That's the original class at Devil's Bowl. That's where it all began, in a stock car. You took an old car, beat the windows out of it, and said, 'Okay, you sons-of-bitches, let's have us a race.'\" -- Thomas Weeks, #5x. The title captures the heart of the film--DIRT is about primal forces: horsepower and ego, passion, fuel and fire. The racecars are usually held together with duct tape. There's nothing fancy about these cars: \"No power steering. These guys never heard of driving with power steering. I'm telling you. These were stock car drivers! Hairy-chested racecar drivers! I mean men. I mean, they'd get in them racecars and beat it up.\" -- Thomas Weeks, #5x. Shot in mixed formats, DIRT is a film about racing, but it's also a film about relationships: \"In a marriage with a racecar driver there are three people involved. Always. And if that third person was another woman you could compete . . . But you can't compete with a racecar.\" -- Missi Smith, wife of racer Doug Smith. This season, one woman dares to ask the question: But can you compete against the men?","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA1MTQ5NTI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg4MDIzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR1,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468473/","userScore":8.5,"voteCount":16,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":81,"diretores":[["Jeff Bowden","nm1965662"],["Greg Biggerstaff","nm0081799"],["Leah Marino","nm1327552"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"165 Hässelby","description":"A documentary about the everyday lives of several youths from the Stockholm suburb of Hässelby, including a young man with ADHD and a music artist.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY5NDkyN2QtMTllZi00MGIwLWJlNzUtMGU1NzM1MzYzNGFlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7323204/","userScore":5.9,"voteCount":8,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Drama"],"runtimeMin":79,"diretores":[["Mia Engberg","nm0257011"]],"atores":[["Dino","nm9245044"],["Camilla Gabrielli","nm9245046"],["Francesco Gabrielli","nm9245043"],["Julio Oleo","nm9245045"],["Ayesha Quraishi","nm4100767"]]},{"title":"Meet the Fockers: The Manary Gland","description":"We get notes from Roach and prop master Eugene McCarthy.

He's cared for, instead, by three of his closest friends - and their video camera - in a remote cabin, 500 miles away from his home in the streets of inner-city St. Louis.

They wrestle with these unsettling times, trying to understand what is right and wrong, what is necessary, what they should believe in, and what they can do. We talk to sons and daughters of soldiers in Iraq, a high school political cheerleading team that protests war, children of activist parents, and cadets at a military boarding school. From ages 4 to 18, they are Caucasian, African-American, Latino, East Asian, East Indian - a portrait of the diversity of America. They speak out passionately on 9-11, the Iraq War, and their hopes and fears for their future. They demand answers: When is war justified? Does protest work? What is worth dying for? Is world peace possible? They express themselves through words, drawings, and play-acting. War in the 21st century will be determined by the children of today. At a time when we are debating the merits and justifications of war, this is a timely and important film, one that reflects on what we're teaching the next generation, and on what they have learned.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjc0ODc0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTYxNzEzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,7,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447535/","userScore":8.9,"voteCount":12,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":26,"diretores":[["Jennifer W.

Three months later, the end of the war would bring forth the fall of the military dictatorship and the beginning of a nightmare for the ex combatants doomed to live in oblivion. Six hundred soldiers died in the battlefield, but more than three hundred fifty decided to put an end to their lives once they returned to their country. Malvinas, the intimate war is a documentary which reviews the facts through the eyes and descriptions of the survivors. A return to the experiences of the real protagonists of the war, capturing the human face of each story.

They both enjoy music and going to the beach. They both want to work for peace. When they were eighteen, they both worried about graduating from high school and making plans for the future. The difference? At eighteen, Maital worried about what college she would attend, while Amitai worried about what unit he would enter in the Israeli Defense Force.

In the summer of 2004, Maital launches a journey to discover what it means to be eighteen in Israel.

It was much more than just a soccer match, when on the 9th of August 1942 the 'FC Start', the Ukrainian workers of the '3rd bakery unit', entered the pitch of the Zenit stadium in Kiev to play against 'Flakelf', the team of the German Air Force, everybody in the Zenit Stadium knew what they were playing for. The spectator stands were packed with people. A year before, on the 19th of September 1941 the German Wehrmacht marched into Kiev. Within two days Nazi regime murdered nearly 34.000 Jews. 630.000 Soviet soldiers became prisoners of war. The deportation of Jews and Ukrainian forced labourers to Germany was running at full steam. The citizens of Kiev were starving. No one could think about playing soccer under such appalling conditions. Yet, no one forgot this sport. What the Nazis could not know: hidden behind the bakery forced labourer's team were some of the best soccer players of Dynamo Kiev, the leading Soviet soccer club, and of his local rival club Lokomotive. Both clubs were officially banned from the soccer all league in the Nazi occupied territories. But the 'FC Start' was allowed to compete with some garrison and soldier teams. The soccer matches were meant to pretend business as usual in wartime. Soccer was supposed to cover Nazi disposal with sportive humanity. The 'FC Start' club with his Dynamo Kiev champions was determined to play to win. No one on the pitch could imagine what a victory of the suppressed ones would lead to. 'The Fatal Eleven' tells the story of a very special match.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6625442/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":45,"diretores":[["Claus Bredenbrock","nm1140916"]],"escritores":[["Claus Bredenbrock","nm1140916"]],"atores":[["Benjamin Völz","nm0905058"]]},{"title":"Ni vieux ni traîtres","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JkZjA4NzEtOGQ0MS00YmEzLThjMjctYjA0ZTYxZmZiYzM0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR1,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453172/","userScore":6.9,"voteCount":38,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":100,"diretores":[["Pierre Carles","nm0137379"],["Georges Minangoy","nm1882861"]],"escritores":[["Pierre Carles","nm0137379"],["Georges Minangoy","nm1882861"]],"atores":[["Joëlle Aubron","nm14835957"],["Annie Desseaux","nm14835958"],["Jacques Garcin","nm14835959"],["Jean Halfen","nm14835960"],["Gilbert Roth","nm14835961"],["Jean-Marc Rouillan","nm7202562"]]},{"title":"Harley Davidson: The Spirit of America","description":"Experience the great American love of motorcycles up close with this sprawling, patriotic look at a modern legend.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM3NTE5NDA2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk3MTAzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456137/","userScore":6.3,"voteCount":22,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Robert Kline","nm0459663"]],"escritores":[["Robert Kline","nm0459663"],["Peter J.

With the help of her third-grade boyfriend \"Timmy\", Pamela locates all 32 members of their unusual class. To her surprise, each member of this dynamic class is just as excited to hear from Pamela, as she is to speak with them. With each classmate found, the exact words are spoken, \"Where is Mr. Bell? He impacted my life more than any other teacher.\" The quest to find their beloved Mr. Bell begins. Mr. Bell was a giant of a man in character. He was the first African American teacher they had ever had. He had touched their hearts and minds and shaped their young spirits. When Mr. Bell is found (now close to 70 years old), another miracle of sorts occurs; despite his long career as an educator and principal, he remembers each and every one of them in vivid detail . . . and what they wanted to be when they grew up! The violence of the 1967 Detroit race-riots impacted their young lives in many ways. They experienced the embracing of new black students into their close-knit class. Through that experience they began to understand the black perspective first-hand. As surrounding violence escalated, Mr. Bells class was scattered, never to see each other again until 35 five years later. They never knew what losing each other meant to their childhoods until their childhood joy comes flooding back to them as adults. And when they compare notes at almost ½ century into their lives, they realize that their favorite African American teacher (their beloved \"Mr. Bell\") had impacted each of their lives and guided them personally in more profound ways than they ever realized. What started out to be a personal journey of discovery for one woman (Pamela Peak) suddenly touched the hearts of millions across America. On Dr. King's Birthday in 2004, ABC News presented the story of their emotional reunion honoring their beloved teacher, \"Mr. Bell\" The timeless lessons of love and nonviolence proved to be as pertinent today as when they were first taught 35 years ago.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNjY3NzEzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI2OTc0MzE@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0806045/","userScore":8.2,"voteCount":20,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":80,"diretores":[["Pamela Peak","nm2270125"]],"escritores":[["Jacqueline Douglas","nm2267311"],["Pamela Peak","nm2270125"]],"atores":[["Lee Aaron","nm2349175"],["Adrianna White Eagle","nm2206784"],["Victoria Leigh","nm5526334"]]},{"title":"Three Days in Orlando","description":"Selling Queer follows several promoters at the 2004 \"Gay Days\" celebration in Orlando, Florida.

The park is located at Oakland and Tamm Avenues, on the south side of Forest Park near the Zoo. In this 30 minute documentary, architect Richard Claybour takes us on a tour of the park's history as we meet the people who helped make Turtle Park come to life. From Anna Beth Caulkin we learn that the Turtle Playground park is a joint project of the city's Department of Parks and the Forest Park Forever organization. Sonya 'Sunny' Glassberg shares with viewers how she was inspired to donate the park for all children, young and old, to honor the memory of her family.

But it is also about tension between America and the Middle East, the dreams of young girls, the dialectic between art and politics and one man's attempt to reinvent his well-known turf in a failing music industry. With numerous tangents, the film takes a journey with Miles Copeland, former manager of the Police and Sting and founder of IRS Records, which was largely responsible for much of the new wave music of the 80's. His father, who was largely responsible for the creation of the CIA, brought his family to live in Syria where Miles first encountered a very different culture. It made sense that after IRS Records and Sting, Miles represented some of the biggest musical acts in the Mideast. American Bellydancer tracks his effort to bring this music deeper into American culture, in spite of our \"issues\" with that part of the world. In Riverdance, the music becomes an engine for pure spectacle as carefully synchronized dancing is put in front of it. With this in mind, Miles began an international search to form a troupe of Bellydancers with the improbable mission of bringing Middle Eastern music to the heart of America. If successful, this would be the first nationally touring troupe of Bellydancers in American history. American Bellydancer tracks the following; an audition process that spans America and beyond, an escalating battle between Miles and the American Bellydance community where some see him as the Anti-Christ come to destroy the sanctity of the art with crass commercialism, a chronicle of the hardships of making a living as a bellydancer, a sudden trip to Bali to try out some of the dancers at a World Peace Music Awards, broadcast to a billion people in Asia in response to the terror bombings there, an American road tour with the huge rock show, Lolapalooza. All this brings the dancers themselves to a transformation from an intimate world to an enormous one where they are expected to shill products, essentially live in a small bus and sacrifice their individual styles to the greater good of group choreography. As to whether or not mass exposure is good for a grass roots art form, or not, that will be left to the viewer.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY0MDA5YjQtNzM3Ni00MmRkLTk3ZDUtMDQ0OWRjY2RkODlmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR1,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466676/","userScore":6.3,"voteCount":27,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":150000,"diretores":[["Jonathan Brandeis","nm0104565"]],"atores":[["Ansuya","nm2014645"],["Rachel Brice","nm1964399"],["Amar Gamal","nm2149957"],["Jillina","nm1960059"],["Kaeshi","nm2149123"],["Suhaila Salimpour","nm1958433"],["Sonia","nm1955442"]]},{"title":"Référendum: En direct avec le président","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457122/","userScore":3.1,"voteCount":9,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"atores":[["Jacques Chirac","nm0158105"],["Emmanuel Chain","nm1101525"],["Jean-Luc Delarue","nm1089495"],["Marc-Olivier Fogiel","nm1314301"],["Yann Lerat","nm5564917"],["Patrick Poivre d'Arvor","nm0688650"]]},{"title":"Burning Wheels","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497021/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":90,"budgetUsd":1000,"diretores":[["Benjamin Eicher","nm1279205"],["Timo Joh.

He managed to combine elements of folk, rock 'n' roll and country, which together with his distinctive voice and guitar style, created an instantly recognisable sound. From his wild early days, fuelled by drink and drugs, through to his later years as a living legend and one of music's elder statesmen he was always a dominant figure. 1994 was to prove to be Cash's only appearance at the Montreux Festival. The \"Man In Black\" had just released his acclaimed American Recordings album and his European tour took in Montreux on July 5. This classic concert features a number of tracks from his new album coupled with favourites from across his career including Folsom Prison Blues, I Walk The Line, Ghost Riders In The Sky, Orange Blossom Special and San Quentin. An added bonus is the guest appearance of his wife June Carter Cash on two tracks. Caught at one of the high points of his distinguished career this is truly Johnny Cash at his best.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlOTNmZjYtMTE5Yy00NWI0LWJkMGYtNDRiMzY5MzUxNjBjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1346976/","userScore":7.7,"voteCount":48,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"runtimeMin":55,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Emmanuel Getaz","nm2249986"]],"atores":[["Johnny Cash","nm0143599"],["Bob Wootton","nm2143913"],["Dave Rowe","nm3328373"],["John Carter Cash","nm0143601"],["June Carter Cash","nm0141745"]]},{"title":"Paimenet","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459494/","userScore":6.5,"voteCount":16,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":92,"diretores":[["Veikko Aaltonen","nm0007399"]],"escritores":[["Veikko Aaltonen","nm0007399"],["Heikki T.

The film is a personal journey that gets to the heart of the story behind the news - following a handful of Thais and foreigners who survived this disaster of biblical proportions. We see what the future really holds for these survivors once the cameras have gone and people's interest at home has faded. Then as the long-term recovery process begins to unfold we hear how their feelings swing between optimism and despair. There has been much coverage of the huge scale of the Tsunami and its aftermath; this film looks at the tragedy at a much more intimate level, putting a human scale on sometimes incomprehensible statistics. The film moves between the neighbouring islands of Koh Lanta and Koh Phi Phi on the west coast of Thailand where the aftermath of the disaster threatens the survival of both communities but in entirely different ways.... When the Thai government turns down the offer of international aid, declaring it can look after its own, the film discovers what kind of support Thai people can really hope for. Both islands rely on tourism to survive but in Lanta, where the journey begins, it looks like the tourist season is over before it even started. Lanta is right in the middle of the disaster zone, but despite being in the path of the wave it was spared much of the horrendous devastation that was suffered by Phi Phi. Lanta's confirmed death toll is 9. In a matter of days the island is back on its feet - but the streets are empty. After a mass exodus in the first 24 hours the international media and foreign offices do nothing to help the situation and despite local protests the advice is to stay away. How will the locals survive and what will the government do to help them? When should the tourists return? What can the locals do to get them back? And are there more alternative ways of providing aid? Jow, a bungalow business owner, is indebted to Pete, a British tourist who nearly died in the wave. He helped to rescue her then stayed on with a few other foreign tourists to help rebuild her business. Butch, a diver who lives in Lanta and finds himself out of work, turns his attentions to the local fisherman and through direct donations from his home in Belgium he gets the first boats back in the water, without any government assistance - it's a joyous occasion. Then hundreds of foreign business owners pull together for a press call on the beach with a banner declaring \"Welcome Back to Lucky Lanta\" - spirits are high but it's a desperate attempt to bring the season back to life and by the end of February hope is fading fast. The tourists aren't coming and Jow, who has yet to receive any government compensation has to resign herself to an uncertain future. For Phi Phi, made famous by \"The Beach\" it's a tragically different story - this massively overdeveloped but beautiful island was decimated, with the loss of life reaching over 1500 and the islanders immediately evacuated. Here is a story of displacement and opportunism. Many of the survivors have lost family and friends and most have lost their businesses but nearly all want to return as soon as possible. But with the infrastructure destroyed and a lack of clarity around the government plan for the rebuild of Phi Phi, the islanders are forced further apart as they search for new ways to make a living. The opportunity for making money on Phi Phi is renowned and rumours abound about how the rebuild might take shape? Will the big businesses move in? Will the islanders ever be able to go back? What is being done to support these people who've lost everything? And when will Phi Phi re-open for business? On Phi Phi we meet Birds, sorting through the few things he has left in his shop. His family were lucky, they are all alive but he's lost all his assets. He loves the money he can make there but soon starts to realise that it could be over a year before he can return. Leaving his family behind in Phuket he heads off to the other side of the country to try and start again. Julie and Ann lost everything and are in severe debt. They camp out at a friend's house in the mainland of Krabi waiting for government handouts through word of mouth, but the days of waiting for depressingly little compensation soon get to them and when they are continually accused by government officials of not being from Phi Phi they lose heart and move to Bangkok to stay with family. We see them in the hectic city, looking lost and donating the little money they have to a charity to buy coffins for the friends they lost. Satana lost her mother, sister, 2 cousins and many of her friends as well as her brand new business. Unlike the others at first she cannot face going back and is unsure about ever returning -- but as the weeks go by she can begin to imagine a life for herself on Phiphi again. In Phuket at a Muslim ceremony, 40 days after she buried them, she says goodbye to her mother and sister and the next day she returns to Phi Phi for the very first time.

The Web conforms and welcomes this new geography of the world that upholds itself on concepts that crash with archaic power structures that still govern our lives: this new map knows little of border lines, does not stop to think about clashes of civilizations, ignoring old work ways and the power relations originated. Behind the screen we will see new faces, different from those created by the mass media where spoiled brats play to break security codes and to create corporate-unmerciful virus. These faces introduce new life style options, new job choices beyond from the big corporation, and joined together by the fight for Free software that, like every other language, does not belong to anybody. Their philosophy brings together different new and inclusive visions, where races, genders, creeds and ages melt within this medley of information without an owner. Come to the world of Hackers of the XXI Century, you may be one of them.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459094/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":52,"budgetUsd":60000,"diretores":[["Juan Luis de No","nm1907971"]],"escritores":[["Javier Gomez Serrano","nm1853559"],["Juan Luis de No","nm1907971"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Tortour de Berlin - Fahrradkuriere hart am Limit","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0924308/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":30,"diretores":[["Carsten Wolf","nm2499019"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"The 100 Greatest Albums","description":"A count down of the top 100 albums of all time as voted for by Channel 4 viewers.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDgyNGE1MjUtNWI2Ny00OWUyLWEzODEtMDMzM2JmNWQ3NThjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR46,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810739/","userScore":6.3,"voteCount":15,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"runtimeMin":240,"diretores":[["Jason Beresford","nm2088902"],["Stuart Ramsay","nm1284158"]],"atores":[["Alexander Armstrong","nm0035602"],["Mark 'Bez' Berry","nm1171634"],["James Brown","nm0113768"],["Tim Burgess","nm1479254"],["Joanne Catherall","nm1782187"],["David Gilmour","nm0319592"],["Andrew Harrison","nm3397149"],["Lauren Laverne","nm0491934"],["Arthur Lee","nm1411958"],["Katie Melua","nm1544454"],["Phil Oakey","nm0643033"],["Yoko Ono","nm0648780"],["Ozzy Osbourne","nm0005285"],["David Quantick","nm0702880"],["Kevin Rowland","nm1377267"],["Shaun Ryder","nm0753145"],["Slash","nm0805298"],["Michael Stipe","nm0005468"]]},{"title":"HIMmeetä valoa","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456968/","userScore":8,"voteCount":27,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":30,"diretores":[["Tommi Mattila","nm1840897"]],"escritores":[["Terja Salaspuro","nm1381514"]],"atores":[["Ville Valo","nm1204517"],["Asko Kallonen","nm1473489"],["Mika Karppinen","nm1890007"],["Mikko Lindström","nm1891050"],["Bam Margera","nm0546640"],["Juhani Merimaa","nm1899427"],["Jonna Nygren","nm1752198"],["Mikko Paananen","nm1897535"],["Janne Puurtinen","nm0701335"],["Terja Salaspuro","nm1381514"],["Seppo Vesterinen","nm1708528"],["Michael Fischer","nm10730793"]]},{"title":"Body Count: Murder for Hire","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUzZGYzMjktNDFkOC00NmU4LTg0YTktYTc2MjVlNjM3NjM3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835024/","userScore":7.7,"voteCount":14,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"runtimeMin":90,"budgetUsd":250000,"diretores":[["Erik Voake","nm2254583"]],"atores":[["Bendrix","nm2841743"],["Jello Biafra","nm0080470"],["Body Count","nm2360417"],["Ernie C","nm1900978"],["Ice-T","nm0001384"],["O.T.","nm2841919"],["Vincent Price","nm2841008"]]},{"title":"Elizabeth & Essex: Battle Royale","description":"Davis famously didn't want Flynn as her co-star, as she considered him unprofessional.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456392/","userScore":8.6,"voteCount":160,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":10,"ageRating":"Not Rated","atores":[["Lincoln Hurst","nm1822256"],["Rudy Behlmer","nm0066935"],["Bob Thomas","nm0858544"],["Nanette Fabray","nm0264660"],["John Mauceri","nm0560754"],["Bette Davis","nm0000012"],["Olivia de Havilland","nm0000014"],["Errol Flynn","nm0001224"]]},{"title":"Voices of North Carolina","description":"An exploration of cultural and linguistic diversity in North Carolina.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMjM1NTI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE2OTU4NjE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1438277/","userScore":7.8,"voteCount":12,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":57,"budgetUsd":60000,"ageRating":"TV-G","diretores":[["Neal Hutcheson","nm2447482"]],"escritores":[["Neal Hutcheson","nm2447482"]],"atores":[["William C.

Like many westerners who have only read about 'the Middle East ' in the newspaper, he expects to find little more that camels, oil wells, sand and strife, but finds that his perceptions are pleasantly inaccurate. The film is strongly informed by Nayla Al Khaja's passionate love for Dubai. The fast-rising UAE director takes obvious pride in unveiling the city to her guest and sharing its many delights with him. Although Unveiling Dubai could have easily fitted into the Arabian Nights section of our festival, we chose to feature it in our 'Operation Cultural Bridge' program because it demonstrates how cultural prejudices can vanish by the simple act of visiting another country and experiencing another culture. This travelogue is about two friends and two cultures coming together in Dubai and we are very proud to feature it.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGE3NDU5MzctNTNhZC00ZTY0LWEyZmItZDVlZjA4ZGFmMzM2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8546008/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Nayla Al Khaja","nm2043534"]],"atores":[["Nayla Al Khaja","nm2043534"],["Nicolas Doldinger","nm2254131"]]},{"title":"Le Pas D'Acier","description":"A two part documentary.

It is his attempt to reconcile the conflicting points of view among Iraqis regarding the war, Saddam Hussein and the occupation; the process of which ultimately changes him and his crew irrevocably. The Dreams of Sparrows is dedicated to Saad Fahker, Associate Producer who died during the production. In the first act we meet Hayder Jabbar, one of the several Iraqi directors chosen by Daffar to contribute to the documentary portrait. After explaining his involvement in the project, Jabbar insists on thanking his savior George Bush, who he loves. Jabbar's convictions at the beginning of the film, contrasted with the bleak and often painful subjects of interview, introduce the essential divide within Iraqi psychology that the movie follows as it develops from the aftermath of war, the capture of Saddam and the realization of occupation. The discourse is maintained through an inquiry into the arts and culture of Baghdad, drawing the viewer into intimate and powerful encounters with Iraqi painters, writers, filmmakers. As the production continues, the interviews increasingly veer towards the politics of occupation and resistance, concluding with the reclaiming of Falluja by local militias and the devastating killing of one of the crew members. In somber self interviews made following the production, the filmmakers reveal the dramatic changes in their characters and beliefs, changes caused not only by the situation in Iraq, but also by the process of documenting it. This movie is the first feature documentary project from the IraqEye Group, a collaboration between American producers and Iraqi filmmakers with the goal of revitalizing Iraqi cinema within the international cinema community.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjcxMjY4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk5OTgyMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463971/","userScore":7.1,"voteCount":81,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":74,"budgetUsd":50000,"ageRating":"Unrated","diretores":[["Hayder Mousa Daffar","nm1952365"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Andrzej Wajda: On Becoming a Filmmaker","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWY1OTM2YmItMzk4NS00YjJhLTgzY2UtNDlmYWRmYzFkYzg0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR155,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466528/","userScore":7.1,"voteCount":22,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":34,"diretores":[["Izabela Frank","nm0006748"],["Izabella Muchlinski","nm1958322"]],"atores":[["Andrzej Wajda","nm0906667"]]},{"title":"Troop 1500","description":"Their mothers may be convicted thieves, murderers and drug dealers, but the girls of Troop 1500 want to be doctors, social workers and marine biologists.

Intimately involved with the troop for several years, the directors (Ellen Spiro and Karen Bernstein) took their cameras far beyond meetings to explore the painful context of broken families.

Since she began to give financial assistance to composers and performers of contemporary music in 1964, she has given a total of 413 grants and commissions for living expenses, compositions, recordings, performances, librettos etc. to 81 artists. Among these artists, who could not have created the works they are known for without the patronage of Betty Freeman, are as famous artists as John Cage, Steve Reich, Robert Wilson and Peter Sellars and also younger composers as the Austrian Olga Neuwirth and the Swiss Hans Peter Kyburz for example. During the era of Gerard Mortier and Hans Landesmann as directors of the Salzburg Festival Betty Freeman gave money for commissioning compositions and paid for entire productions such as for \"L'Amour de Loin\" by the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho. Betty Freeman maintains strong personal relations to artists whom she supports and is therefore an important witness of the development of contemporary music. The documentary contains interviews with music- and arts-people whom she is in touch with and sequences of the music and productions which were made possible by her generosity, staged especially for this film.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4NzAzNjY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQzOTkyMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR3,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459079/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":150000,"diretores":[["Paul

Last spring a film crew from TSI crossed the Cursed Mountains of northern Albania to look into the historical and social origins of the medieval laws that make up the Kanun, the Code. They recorded a series of tales of murder, desperate flight, lives struck dumb \"tethered\", by a modern mob, under the guise of an age-old tradition.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM2YmJmOGItNWUxZC00MjhiLTg1NTAtYjA1NDVmZDg3YmRhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Inchiodato","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14395964/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":53,"diretores":[["Elvira Dones","nm3199167"],["Fulvio Mariani","nm0547069"]],"escritores":[["Elvira Dones","nm3199167"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Methexis","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZjN2MzNGEtNzJiOC00Y2I0LWIxOGItZTkxYzc4M2I4MzkyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR92,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1569459/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"runtimeMin":54,"diretores":[["Giorgos Botsos","nm2749463"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"HairKuTT","description":"The Reel Life story of man's cold turkey detox from his 15 year addiction to heroin.

After moving to Brooklyn, One Ring Zero's founding members, Joshua Camp and Michael Hearst, discovered a curious unmarked store that doubled as a makeshift office for McSweeney's, an offbeat publishing company founded by author Dave Eggers. In addition to selling an odd assortment of products ranging from small rubber cubes to lumberjack supplies, the peculiar storefront also served as the venue for weekly literary readings that brought a variety of both burgeoning and established writers to the tiny space. With Camp on accordion and Hearst on claviola, they soon began performing regularly at the events and ultimately invited a handful of authors to contribute lyrics. After receiving contributions from a variety of celebrated writers including Paul Auster, Jonathan Lethem, Rick Moody and Dave Eggers, the duo then faced the challenge of setting this diverse compilation of lyrics to music. Featuring live performances, studio sessions, and interviews with the writers and musicians, AS SMART AS THEY ARE explores the relationships between music and literature while painting a portrait of the literary community that fostered the band.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMDExNDg1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIyOTIxMw@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR3,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454782/","userScore":8.4,"voteCount":40,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":63,"diretores":[["Joe Pacheco","nm1896007"]],"escritores":[["Joe Pacheco","nm1896007"]],"atores":[["Joshua Camp","nm1637033"],["Michael Hearst","nm1637048"],["Paul Auster","nm0000808"],["Rick Moody","nm0600528"],["Jonathan Lethem","nm0504672"],["Dave Eggers","nm1101630"],["Jonathan Ames","nm0024718"],["Myla Goldberg","nm1503335"],["Darin Strauss","nm1555167"],["Lawrence Krauser","nm1899459"],["Amy Fusselman","nm1897988"],["Clay McLeod Chapman","nm1626455"],["Syd Straw","nm0833931"],["Olivier Conan","nm1897967"],["Allyssa Lamb","nm1893750"],["Scott Seeley","nm1890895"],["Jason Kellermeyer","nm1893314"],["Krista Overby","nm1898002"]]},{"title":"Cuba: Beyond the Pearl of the Antilles","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457315/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":80,"diretores":[["Joycelyn Bejar","nm1673177"]],"escritores":[["Joycelyn Bejar","nm1673177"]],"atores":[["David Anthony Pizzuto","nm0686257"]]},{"title":"Julio Verne, de la novela al cine","description":"Documentary about the films based on Jules Verne's novels.

People's bank accounts disappeared in a single night, impounded by the government. The rebellion of the people was muffled by the silence of the international monetary authorities, the very authorities that had heaped praise on the economic model set up in Buenos Aires. Disjunction chronicles how people reacted to the crisis ten months later, what they set up to keep going, to provide a future for their families. The very first \"resource\" to be exploited was garbage - many became garbage collectors. They were called cartoneros. In time, Argentineans conceived of even more effective responses to their fate. Workers occupied factories, organizing themselves into cooperatives; they created an economy supported by, and linked to their own neighborhoods. The effort was expected by experts to fail.

Experience an intimate journey into this magnificent region through the eyes of an artist compelled to capture on canvas this remarkable land. Along with his young family, Cory Trépanier spent almost a month in each season exploring and painting this magnificent wilderness by canoe and kayak, on foot and by snowshoe. Filmed over the entirety of the excursions, this documentary explores the creative process in the first person, bringing the viewer into the artist's mind as he paints from the land, and from his canoe, on location. It shares the adventure of exploring and creating in these challenging environments, and the rewards of taking children into the wilderness, exposing them to fragile and important ecosystems. This timeless, inspiring story will leave viewers with a greater appreciation for our environment, our families, and of course art, as they embark on a journey through an artist's eyes, words and paintings.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGYzMDY3ZjItNmYzOC00YWEwLTk1YzQtYzc2MTJkYmYxY2I1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR1,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7327694/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":47,"budgetUsd":10000,"diretores":[["Cory Trepanier","nm4175006"]],"escritores":[["Cory Trepanier","nm4175006"]],"atores":[["Andie Trepanier","nm4172021"],["Cory Trepanier","nm4175006"],["Janet Trepanier","nm4172152"],["Sydney Trepanier","nm4173805"]]},{"title":"Selena: Noche de estrellas","description":"A TV special featuring stars on a red carpet before a concert broadcasted live and produced by Univision Network on behave of the 10th anniversary of the death of Mexican-American star Selena.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473083/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"atores":[["Pepe Aguilar","nm0013591"],["Ana Barbara","nm1312310"],["Graciela Beltrán","nm0069648"],["Barrio Boyz","nm1673589"],["Raul Brindis","nm1993761"],["Ana Maria Canseco","nm1298525"],["Tony Dandrades","nm1049696"],["Raul de Molina","nm0210384"],["Gloria Estefan","nm0002065"],["Lili Estefan","nm0261557"],["Fey","nm1926655"],["Alejandra Guzmán","nm0350031"],["Jessica Maldonado","nm1994686"],["Karla Martinez","nm1051314"],["Rafael Mercadante","nm0580131"],["Bobby Pulido","nm1632176"],["Abraham Quintanilla Jr.","nm0704148"],["A.B.

A world where the sidewalk moves and colors dance. A world where light is not from the grace above but a painful reminder that they have forgotten their sunglasses. A world where a grocery store is hell. But- their world also carries a reborn heaven in each breath. It's simplicity is the greatest gift given to them: the sunset, a jog in the hill, cool air, homemade soup, a fire, their lover's hands on their neck. The quiet of mid-day alone.

Director/Producer Roy Szuper, brother-in-law and music fanatic Concert Joe, and punk rocker Tony Petrozza, set out to create the 1st Annual Williamsburg Music Festival as a statement of protest against the incoming Republican National Convention. Joe acts as our guide through the New York music scene while Szuper borrows money, seeks advice, and secures talent for the festival. Along the way we meet legendary activist/musician, David Peel, who entertains us with his history of political irreverence. We also interview another New York legend in Hilly Kristal, founder of CGGB's, who touches on topics such as the corporatization of music and the impending closing of CB's. After tremendous financial maneuvering and miles of red tape created by the city bureaucracy in their pre-RNC paranoia, the festival takes place as scheduled, 9 days before the RNC. Despite all the hard work and expectations, torrential rains put a damper on the festival. Despite the rains, 8 bands performed including David Peel, Tony Petrozza and his band SQNS, Dana Fuchs, the city's most intense subway performer Shakerleg, and headliner Vernon Reid and friends. Despite the financial disaster for producer Roy Szuper, the spirit of the festival carries us through to the RNC. Once there, we experience the largest protest in the history of any political convention in history and the premiere activist concert of RNC week featuring Tom Morello and Michael Franti and Spearhead.

The film presents audiences with a window into the everyday realities for those living through this controversial war. The film documents how life is for the society and people living under twelve years of sanctions and the regime of Saddam Hussein. When the inevitability of the US-led conflict increased and people across the globe protested the war, the filmmakers recorded the changes in the lives of the Iraqi people, focusing on a cross-section of individuals representative of the broader Iraqi community. The film follows these individuals as they prepare for the coalition war against their country and as it becomes the target for tens of thousands of coalition cruise missiles and guided bombs.

However, she also knows that progress exacts a price-a realization rendered vividly and with poignant candor in Chang's portrait of her headstrong amah. Tracing the parallel threads of her female relatives' stories, Chang (SHE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU, SFIAAFF '02) uncovers revelations of political persecution while focusing on the struggle to maintain-and sometimes resist-the bonds of filial traditions. A mesmerizing and provocative meditation on history-making and the post-colonial condition, this dynamic documentary intimately depicts what it means to be a part of a family, a nation, and a world in constant upheaval.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1646092/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":54,"diretores":[["Anita Chang","nm2278221"]],"escritores":[["Anita Chang","nm2278221"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"The Cross and Bones","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0461926/","userScore":5.9,"voteCount":15,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":69,"diretores":[["Paul Carrière","nm0140653"]],"atores":[["D'Arcy Browning","nm3296060"],["Tree Browning","nm1724249"]]},{"title":"I poeti, le città","description":"The four County Seats of Abruzzo, Italy (L'Aquila, Pescara, Teramo, Chieti), plus San Vito Chietino, a place dear to Gabriele D'Annunzio -

Today, the now forty-year-old transsexual lives in Venice and has changed her name to Nicole. She has undergone a hormone treatment and grown breasts, but she still lives inside the body of a middle-aged man, including a penis, a beard and a substantial Adam's apple. This is why Nicole is applying for a sex change through official channels. 'I never thought it would be so hard. I thought making the decision was enough,' she says. During five tense years, Nicole fights her emotional and physical struggle in the presence of director Alberto Vendemmiati's camera. Working as an actress, a seller of carnival masks and a prostitute, she finances her cosmetic treatments and looks forward to the subsidised sex change operation. Meanwhile, she turns to her elderly mother for support, who has a hard time accepting that her son will soon be a daughter.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjE2ZTIwNzAtZTZhZC00NWIyLTg0NGItMjkyZjZjZDQ0MGQ3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR3,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758433/","userScore":7.8,"voteCount":37,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":85,"budgetUsd":100000,"diretores":[["Alberto Vendemmiati","nm0892928"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"And Thereafter","description":"A documentary following the life of a Korean woman who came to the USA when she married a GI after the Korean War.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497016/","userScore":7.9,"voteCount":19,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":56,"diretores":[["Hosup Lee","nm2122128"]],"escritores":[["Hosup Lee","nm2122128"]],"atores":[["William Wike","nm2121196"],["Young-Ja Wike","nm2116310"]]},{"title":"La oficina","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455666/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":80,"diretores":[["Blas Eloy Martínez","nm1875071"]],"escritores":[["Blas Eloy Martínez","nm1875071"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Giovanni Paolo II: Sine die","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwZGVhZWYtNzdiOC00Yjg3LTk5MmItNDMxNzU0MzI1NGY1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR3,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31064382/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":55,"diretores":[["Roberto Burchielli","nm1076140"]],"escritores":[["Roberto Burchielli","nm1076140"],["Salvatore Mazza","nm15763698"],["Mauro Parissone","nm2898837"]],"atores":[["Pope John Paul II","nm0937552"]]},{"title":"Creature Editing 101","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk4MTZhMWMtMWFmNC00YWVkLWFkZDAtNGE5MGExYTk2NzZhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491632/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":10,"escritores":[["Suzanne Bultmeyer","nm1598274"]],"atores":[["Patrick Lussier","nm0527261"]]},{"title":"Now & Then: The Locations of the Claws of Axos","description":"A look at the location work of the Doctor Who serial \"The Claws of Axos\", narrated by Katy Manning.

The mosaic is composed of 8mm and16mm film, personal videos of the artist that serve as a kind of diary, televisual archives, as well as interviews with the artist's peers, including Claude Péloquin, Marcel Saint-Pierre and Claude Jasmin. With his installations, performances and Land Art, Lemoyne shook the Quebec art scene beginning in 1963 with multidisciplinary events combining poetry, music, painting and dance. He also introduced Quebec to the spirit and practice of Pop Art. For Lemoyne, the boundary between art and life was blurred. For ten years he went through his \"red, white and blue\" period, the colours of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and its stars Jean Béliveau, Guy Lafleur and Ken Dryden. From the early eighties until his death, he worked at transforming his native house of Acton Vale-destroyed by arson two years after his death-into a work of art, questioning in the process the nature of art and its role in society.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWI0NTZmYTMtNDBjYi00NmQ4LThiNzItODA5ZDQxOTQxZGUzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR3,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791181/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":80,"budgetUsd":207000,"diretores":[["Simon Beaulieu","nm2225261"],["Benjamin Hogue","nm2226735"],["Christian Laramée","nm2226190"]],"escritores":[["Simon Beaulieu","nm2225261"],["Benjamin Hogue","nm2226735"],["Christian Laramée","nm2226190"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"School Mizugi Audition PART 5","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32896578/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":75,"atores":[["Shinobu Aoshima","nm16339514"],["Yukari Honda","nm16339516"],["Mamiko Karasawa","nm16339515"],["Naomi Kinoshita","nm16339518"],["Yuuki Takasugi","nm16339519"],["Rika Tanaka","nm16339517"]]},{"title":"Return Home: Photo Montage","originalTitle":"Photo Montage","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7091318/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":8,"atores":[["Ray Argall","nm0034441"],["Mickey Camilleri","nm0131810"],["Dennis Coard","nm0167594"],["Frankie J.
