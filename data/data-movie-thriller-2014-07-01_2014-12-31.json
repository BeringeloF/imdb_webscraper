This peculiarity has led her to study the psychophysiology of dreams and to follow a therapy with Sean, her mentor and boyfriend, to try and understand the origin of her nightmares. Following the death of her maternal grandmother she hardly knew, Jessica reluctantly returns to the family home. She doesn't get along with her mother very well and is not looking forward to seeing her again. Upon her arrival, Jessica discovers that her late grandmother is lying in the adjoining room to her own during the wake. After a rough first night made restless by a strange nightmare in which she meets her dead grandmother, Jessica suddenly becomes ill. Stuck in bed with a high fever, the young woman decides to use her lethargic state to try out lucid dreaming. In order to do so, and on Sean's advice, Jessica breathes a little bit of ether whenever she needs to sink deeper into the other world to try and take control of her nightmares. Jessica then begins to wander in a nightmarish world inhabited by twisted versions of her family members. She gradually improves her skills as a lucid dreamer and investigates to solve the mystery that gnaws her and haunts the family home...","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4Njc2MjYxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg1NTI2MzE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR8,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2242176/","userScore":4.8,"voteCount":1985,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Fantasy","Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":89,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Romain Basset","nm3373941"]],"escritores":[["Romain Basset","nm3373941"],["Karim Chériguène","nm3940352"]],"atores":[["Lilly-Fleur Pointeaux","nm0688455"],["Catriona MacColl","nm0531529"],["Murray Head","nm0372158"],["Gala Besson","nm2314664"],["Fu'ad Aït Aattou","nm2227118"],["Vernon Dobtcheff","nm0229943"],["Philippe Nahon","nm0619600"],["Joe Sheridan","nm0792189"],["Paul Bandey","nm0051720"],["Emmanuel Bonami","nm1655586"],["Shane Woodward","nm3822235"],["Nathan Willcocks","nm1229301"],["André Kobtzeff","nm3281480"]]},{"title":"Big Driver","description":"A famous mystery writer sets out for revenge after a brutal attack.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MjA0MDcwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg5NjYwMzE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3831810/","userScore":5.6,"voteCount":6876,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":87,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Mikael Salomon","nm0004121"]],"escritores":[["Stephen King","nm0000175"],["Richard Christian Matheson","nm1075295"]],"atores":[["Maria Bello","nm0004742"],["Ann Dowd","nm0235652"],["Will Harris","nm1705317"],["Joan Jett","nm0005053"],["Olympia Dukakis","nm0001156"],["Jennifer Kydd","nm1219077"],["Andre Myette","nm4469249"],["Juanita Peters","nm1203829"],["Mary-Colin Chisholm","nm0158285"],["Kim Parkhill","nm1743069"],["Deborah Allen","nm0020439"],["Tara Nicodemo","nm1107283"],["Roland Marko Simmonds","nm6854050"],["Mike Taylor","nm6854051"],["Lee J.

A woman who challenges men becomes targeted as a public enemy. Young men expose her identity and even show up on her doorstep. But what they find is MIN Ha-young, the woman who had hanged herself.

Two young men Ji-woong and Yong-min who were preparing for the police academy exam become involved in the case. What apparently looks like suicide is held under suspicion by the two as foul play. After posing the possibility of homicide, the young men return to the crime scene. However mystery itself does not seem to be the point of this film as it gradually exposes during the course of finding the truth to MIN Ha-young's death, her life as it really was and what the two men in pursuit of the real cause of her death wanted to prove.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVjOGRkN2QtZWFmZS00ZWMyLWE2YTYtZjg0NzI2MWU0Njk1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"So-syeol-po-bi-a","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4203200/","userScore":6.4,"voteCount":573,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":100,"revenue":1750719,"ageRating":"PG-13","diretores":[["Seok-jae Hong","nm4664623"]],"escritores":[["Seok-jae Hong","nm4664623"]],"atores":[["Byun Yo-han","nm5374796"],["Lee Joo-seung","nm3727364"],["Jin-soo Byeon","nm6916724"],["Lee Gang-wook","nm5604881"],["Oh Hee-joon","nm6654605"],["Ji-ho Im","nm6916721"],["Jeong Jae-woo","nm6916723"],["Ryu Jun-yeol","nm6916719"],["Park Keun-rok","nm4522499"],["Nam Moon-cheol","nm3738748"],["Jeon Sin-hwan","nm4735772"],["Kim So-sook","nm11250625"],["Park Ye-young","nm10463889"],["Kim Yong-joon","nm6916722"],["Dae-hyeong Yoo","nm6916720"],["Bae Yoo-ram","nm5589490"],["Ha Yoon-kyung","nm6916718"]]},{"title":"Money Ratnam","description":"Neil comes across an unexpected incident, while returning after the New Year party.

In the present day, a skeptical archaeologist (Marcus Rush) has been on a quest to find evidence of the supernatural so he can use modern technology to analyze and debunk it. His search has depleted his life savings, and made him a laughing stock in academic society. But he has finally found hard evidence giving him the location of an island where he will find a centuries-old, dead-and-buried coven of witches. Before he can even leave for the island, devious individuals who want the witches' remains for themselves try to stop him. Marcus cons a group of hard-core mercenaries into joining him for protection, with promises of an easy gig and easy money. Not long after arriving, Marcus and his team are assaulted by a group of soldiers intent on getting to the witches first. The action builds through firefights all over the island, followed by an even more disturbing revelation - have the witches been revived?","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUyMTlhMjgtMTE1OC00Mzk3LWI5OTktN2IzODFlYzU4YzVlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR123,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3210732/","userScore":7.6,"voteCount":22,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":93,"budgetUsd":1200000,"diretores":[["Ray Eddy","nm2623919"],["Matthew Gunnoe","nm0348323"]],"escritores":[["Matthew Gunnoe","nm0348323"],["Ray Eddy","nm2623919"]],"atores":[["Ray Eddy","nm2623919"],["James Winburn","nm0934555"],["William Smith","nm0810342"],["Rimma Magdessian","nm5968781"],["Jeffrey Dal Robinson","nm3494494"],["Darryl Baldwin","nm1956732"],["Aaron Zoldan","nm5618719"],["Andy Niederdorfer","nm5968779"],["Anwar Albaba","nm2421962"],["Mike Adsit","nm5968780"],["Vercho Sokolov","nm5968782"],["Dmitro Zlodyugin","nm5968783"],["Mark Taylor","nm0852838"],["David Veitch","nm2355714"],["Leander Suleiman","nm2245226"],["Daniel Wachs","nm3911270"],["Alex Zuko","nm3774462"],["Cindy Karr","nm4107892"]]},{"title":"Together Alone","description":"Questions arise about love, sexuality, and the breakdown of relationships and traditional roles surface as tension builds and weaves a love triangle into an erotic knot.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1Mjk0N2ItYjM4Ni00NzBhLWI1Y2MtMGJiMzlkZjhmNGVhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR9,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3479676/","userScore":6.4,"voteCount":17,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":78,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Mateo Guez","nm0346519"]],"escritores":[["Tara Boire","nm1545593"],["Joseph Rafla","nm3335480"],["Nancy Smit","nm6388436"]],"atores":[["Jon Rhys","nm5960216"],["Toni Evangelista","nm6283386"],["Lucas Chan","nm6283385"]]},{"title":"Earthrise","description":"Humanity now lives on Mars.

Dragging his troubled daughter Kendall along with him, he simultaneously reunites with his estranged sister, Stella and reignites a past rivalry with the corrupt town sheriff, Rex Drisko. Convinced that there is more behind Lexie's death than is being said, Dominic begins digging around the town, probing its strange inhabitants, and in the process unearths his own demons and uncovers the town's dark secrets, which include a mysterious cult, a supernatural curse, a masked killer, and a very high body count.

It is an international art house film from Bengal which, as a piece of social document, tries to capture the changing face of morality, the degeneration of values, the increasing pollution of the spoken language, and the changing social fabric of Bengal through three stories. Spread over a hundred years, the three stories are structured in the manner of the classical Three Act Play with each act (read story) exploring one facet of an obsessive relationship outside the purview of marriage. ACT 1 The first film NABALOK (time period 1920-1954) is shot in black and white. This period piece is the story of an 8-year-old boy's emotional attachment and obsession with a newly-married girl. The film opens in Calcutta and moves to rural Bengal. ACT 2 The second film POST MORTEM (time period 1978) is a technicolor film. It is an ambitious single-room drama about two men - the lover and the husband - of a woman who has ended her life the evening before. Through the dialogue between the two characters we see a third emerge and discover the frailties of each relationship and what role each man had in the woman's suicide. ACT 3 The third film TELEPHONE (time period 2013) is the modern age digital film. This Roald Dahl-esque story with a series of twists and turns looks into the darkness that looms beneath the surface of human beings and how manipulative human relationships have become.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE0ZmMwMmMtODFjNy00ZDJiLWJiMDEtOGUxMGE2N2FiMWI2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3479530/","userScore":7.1,"voteCount":260,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":124,"budgetUsd":300000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Bauddhayan Mukherji","nm5695557"]],"escritores":[["Abhinandan Banerjee","nm6232355"],["Bauddhayan Mukherji","nm5695557"],["Bibhutibhusan Mukhopadhyay","nm4479746"]],"atores":[["Suman Mukhopadhyay","nm2655736"],["Kharaj Mukherjee","nm1425584"],["Ratan Sarkhel","nm2138865"],["Manasi Sinha","nm4110994"],["Bhadra Basu","nm4690866"],["Biswanath Basu","nm3392688"],["Monu Mukherjee","nm0611540"],["Ananya Sen","nm6232348"],["Barshan Seal","nm6232349"],["Parvathy Baul","nm6232350"],["Joy Sengupta","nm1372014"],["Sabyasachi Chakrabarty","nm0149837"],["Phalguni Chatterjee","nm2160929"],["Rituparna Sengupta","nm0784292"],["Ashish Vidyarthi","nm0896573"],["Dhritiman Chatterjee","nm0154122"],["Sumanta Mukherjee","nm1137410"],["Kaushik Mukherjee","nm6232351"]]},{"title":"Knifeman","description":"Set in 18th century London, Knifeman will focus on the untold story of a charming, arrogant, decorum-breaking genius who challenges societal norms to transform his visions into cutting-edge discoveries.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2225368/","userScore":5.8,"voteCount":15,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Craig Zisk","nm0957197"]],"escritores":[["Wendy Moore","nm5122774"],["Rolin Jones","nm1289754"],["Ron Fitzgerald","nm3059930"]],"atores":[["Tom Hollander","nm0390903"],["Daniel Mays","nm0990547"],["Simon McBurney","nm0564402"],["Mark Stobbart","nm1123403"],["Adam O'Byrne","nm6889196"],["Patricia Winker","nm4716838"],["Paul Blackwell","nm0085944"],["Oliver Gilbert","nm2763100"],["Richard Stanley","nm6386603"],["Pamela Ashton","nm5660709"],["Andy Gillies","nm1927998"],["Jonathan Rushby-Taylor","nm5240028"],["Rudy Valentino Grant","nm4112921"],["Tina Holland","nm6893290"],["David Swift","nm5043434"],["Paul Bergquist","nm4800427"],["Andrew Waldron","nm8620236"],["Nigel Black","nm8619189"]]},{"title":"Moonshine","description":"In Hixson, Tennessee on an ill winter's night.

Their happiness is short-lived as his past catches up and Maya is abducted by the ones whom he wronged. Agastya is troubled with conflicts and regrets, as a much larger scheme unfolds. And the film begins. The story follows Agastya in two timelines. One has him alone in an empty, seemingly endless dry land; clueless, he is guided by music from his past, things that appear and disappear in ways beyond reason as he is moved closer to the man controlling the strings. The music reminds him of last memories - of Maya, his wife who was abducted by a family that rivaled his when he was a crime-lord. He faces conflict as to save his wife, he may need to become what he once was, what Maya changed into who he now is. Do you really live after you lose something you love or do you just pass the days as your soul remains stuck in time? If to save that something, if you change yourself, are you responsible for the duties you leave, the expectations you dishonor because of that change?","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE4NjMzODItNzY2OS00MzhkLThhNTctMWI3NGYxNTMyNGZlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR244,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3858182/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":76,"diretores":[["Rishav Rastogi","nm4541744"]],"escritores":[["Rishav Rastogi","nm4541744"]],"atores":[["Sourav Bangotra","nm4541791"],["Karan Kantoor","nm4550108"],["Rana Nayar","nm6644709"],["Subha Rajput","nm6644710"],["Udit Narain Satsangi","nm6644711"]]},{"title":"The Drifter","description":"A troubled man finds himself on a downward spiral induced by dark memories of his past.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGE5YmJiY2UtY2M1NS00MmQ0LWFmNTItNmQzOGQ4ZDg0OWU3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3210836/","userScore":5.3,"voteCount":67,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":96,"diretores":[["Craig Calamis","nm3643608"]],"escritores":[["Danny Bellini","nm3596336"],["Craig Calamis","nm3643608"],["Daniel Smith","nm5968948"]],"atores":[["Christopher Lee Gibson","nm3359516"],["Bruce Jarman","nm2012669"],["Amanda Powell","nm4494026"],["Fred Lasday","nm3563394"],["Enrico Marcellino","nm2608912"],["Danielle Alagna","nm4804116"],["Corey Calamis","nm4603100"],["Jack McAllister","nm4654977"],["Lee Karlinsky","nm5463188"],["Michael Lane","nm5968963"],["Melissa Eaton","nm4762505"],["Ashleigh Miller","nm6657413"],["Zachary Miller","nm6657414"],["Jayvo Scott","nm4747149"],["Savino Bellini","nm2145122"],["Danny Bellini","nm3596336"]]},{"title":"Everything Will Be Fine","description":"Follow Alien and Lady through the trials and tribulations of being homeless.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxOTk1NTM0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg2Nzc1MjE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR6,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3551184/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":92,"diretores":[["P.M.

Most of them are very young and come from diverse backgrounds: students, housewives, petty criminals, chavs, a building caretaker, even a priest...\n\nUsing their internet nicknames to speak to each other everything, even down to the minute details, is recorded on the cameras they carry themselves and others the host has installed all over the house and garden. The twenty-four get to know each other; some try to pull, others simply share confidences about their favourite books and films, they discuss their ideas and objectives in life and talk about their origins. Just as if they were at a pretty normal party. Nothing indicates that at midnight on Friday everything is going to change. Their lives, from that moment on, will take a radical turn. Maybe fame awaits them, recognition on the networks, maybe prison... or maybe simply death. After walking into The Harvest nothing will ever be the same.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNDU5MzExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM2OTc0MzE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4203258/","userScore":5.1,"voteCount":50,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Comedy","Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":84,"budgetUsd":30000,"diretores":[["Roberto Santiago","nm0763634"]],"escritores":[["Pablo Fernández Vázquez","nm1563059"],["Roberto Santiago","nm0763634"]],"atores":[["Elena Alférez","nm4639766"],["Fran Antón","nm2543329"],["Alejandro Arestegui","nm1648003"],["Mariano Estudillo","nm5320944"],["Álvaro Fontalba","nm4391123"],["Jonathan Galera","nm6968781"],["Aintzane Garreta","nm5654564"],["Manu Hernández","nm3875793"],["Borja Inglés","nm6027742"],["Samy Khalil","nm6289739"],["Iris López","nm6878670"],["Raquel Meleiro","nm6923197"],["Jorge Monje","nm1110200"],["Andrea Moral","nm7019118"],["Tomy Moreno","nm6923200"],["Marilyn Mosquera","nm6923258"],["Teresa Máiquez","nm6923196"],["Esther Pastor","nm6923198"]]},{"title":"Preying for Mercy","description":"Frank Gates is an LAPD cop with a rocky past and a dark secret.

The two of them live a wonderful middle class life of unconditional love, that is until Cedric purchases a beautiful watch set as a tenth year wedding anniversary gift for the two of them. The call Debra received from the hospital the next day sent her on a three day journey of emotions that she never thought she'd encounter about someone she'd spent ten years of her life loving unconditionally. After a visit to the hospital a nurse had informed Debra of something that made her suspicious about the watch that she was wearing, and in turn sent her on a hunt for the truth. The next day Debra met with Gloria, who was the previous owner of the watch, and was informed of what she had been through from the man that gave her that same watch as a gift as an apology for the abuse he'd inflicted upon her. She explained why she sold the watch back to the store owner and why Cedric's life was in danger. Once the conversation between the two concluded Gloria gave her the business card of a woman who could bring an end to all disoriented thoughts that now plagued her mind. Debra didn't hesitate to set an appointment with Madame Devine so that she could clear her mind of all the strenuous stress that had now taken over her life. She couldn't help but to think that somehow Cedric's new beautiful right hand woman Nicole, played a part in all that was going on with her husband. Unfortunately her visit to Madame Devine didn't defuse the situation it only brought about more suspense. Debra was now faced with a decision that would leave her wavering in the faith of her husband's love, which will ultimately determine their fate.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNzM1ODU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4OTY2MjE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR14,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3961952/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Action","Drama","Mystery","Romance","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":54,"budgetUsd":3000,"diretores":[["Micah Parkerson","nm6860270"],["Willie Robbins","nm6685122"]],"escritores":[["Brenda Y Marlow","nm6708762"],["Willie Robbins","nm6685122"]],"atores":[["Deborah Belizaire","nm6860273"],["Donte Mishawn Bond","nm6860263"],["Robin Frelix","nm6860259"],["Valerie Frierson","nm6860261"],["Samanatha Graves","nm6860271"],["Renard Hirsch","nm6860272"],["Lavonda Jones","nm6860267"],["Cortez Lee","nm6860262"],["Shaleashae March-Holden","nm6860266"],["Clyde Norfleet","nm6860260"],["Debbie Powell","nm6708761"],["Terrance Shoremaster","nm6860268"],["Nina Hibbler Webster","nm2347347"],["Shawn Whitsell","nm1392273"]]},{"title":"The Empty","description":"A man destroyed by the death of his wife finds refuge in a crumbling apartment building where all of his darkest fears begin to come to life.

Determined to prove her teacher wrong and demonstrate that by following her ten step plan the bank can be taken for millions. Giorgia skips school, walks into a regional bank branch and holds up the teller, Isaak Misidis (Costas Mandylor) at gun point.
