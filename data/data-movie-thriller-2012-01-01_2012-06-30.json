Kevin is obsessed with finding a girl who can help him forget his unpleasant past. However, all his encounters with the opposite sex inevitably go afoul, creating more awkward experiences than he can cope with. As the rejections mount, Kevin's futile search for happiness and love becomes overwhelmingly turbulent, forcing him to take desperate measures. Shot in a variety of NYC locales, from Hell's Kitchen to Greenpoint, Forgetting the Girl is a gritty vision of the city and its denizens. The tightly-woven drama blends recollections with reality to craft an intense character study of the psychologically-scarred protagonist. As beautiful as it is dark, the tense narrative slowly boils under the surface until it unleashes an unsettling climax that will not be easily forgotten.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5Nzc5MDU3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzkyMDkyMDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR1,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1492842/","userScore":5.2,"voteCount":1073,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":85,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Nate Taylor","nm0852948"]],"escritores":[["Peter Moore Smith","nm2432884"]],"atores":[["Christopher Denham","nm1706832"],["Lindsay Beamish","nm0063750"],["Elizabeth Rice","nm0723415"],["Paul Sparks","nm0817027"],["Anna Camp","nm2319871"],["Phyllis Somerville","nm0813902"],["Joel de la Fuente","nm0209249"],["Holley Fain","nm2367213"],["Creighton James","nm2247835"],["Shayna Levine","nm0505954"],["Lauren Weisman","nm2789794"],["Chandler Frantz","nm2608518"],["Caitlin Carmichael","nm2965079"],["Shelby Keeton","nm3588949"],["Steve Routman","nm0746156"],["Nikkole Salter","nm2202013"],["Maurice Tyson","nm0879178"],["Brenton Duplessie","nm4097817"]]},{"title":"Ambuli","description":"Two students plan to investigate a strange phenomenon that they came across in a field during their summer holidays.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU5MjBlMTctNDA5YS00YzdhLThlNGItZGEzYzVlOGU4OWY0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR8,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1841504/","userScore":5.7,"voteCount":354,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":139,"budgetUsd":96000000,"diretores":[["Harish Narayan","nm4223986"],["K.

We meet a wide range of characters - from spoiled rich brats to real bottom-feeding criminal scum, and everyone in-between. In the best traditions of Commedia dell'arte, the characters each have easily recognizable roles - although there are a few twists to throw the audience off and keep things fresh. The story revolves around a few odd coincidences and a ****load of bad decisions, which all result in a really messed-up Friday. It starts out innocently enough with jokes, fun and a bit of alcohol, but given the level of intellectual capacity in our leading characters, you can see the train wreck coming. And when some drugged out punks - who have a rather tenuous relationship with reality during best of days - go all Clockwork Orange on an opera loving cankerous old man, it can only end up in tears (and blood, guts and bit of rather literal toilet humour as well).","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE0ODViZDgtNTVlZi00MjdjLTk1NTktMDdjYWRmODZlOWY5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Vasaku jala reede","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2106744/","userScore":6.6,"voteCount":621,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":100,"budgetUsd":36000,"diretores":[["Andres Kõpper","nm4900086"],["Arun Tamm","nm4764412"]],"escritores":[["Martin Algus","nm1307222"],["Andres Poom","nm4763962"],["Birk Rohelend","nm4910205"]],"atores":[["Priit Loog","nm2948384"],["Ott Lepland","nm3654469"],["Hasan Steinberg","nm4910192"],["Risto Proosa","nm4910206"],["Mart Müürisepp","nm2960239"],["Taavi Teplenkov","nm1106519"],["Priit Võigemast","nm1273350"],["Ivo Uukkivi","nm0882616"],["Hendrik Toompere Jr.","nm0867545"],["Ago Roo","nm0740192"],["Martin Algus","nm1307222"],["Sten Karpov","nm3255649"],["Madis Veltman","nm4910220"],["Lauri Pedaja","nm2596491"],["Raivo Trass","nm0871143"],["Martin Mill","nm1835769"],["Gerli Rosenfeld","nm4910201"],["Tagne Võip","nm4910190"]]},{"title":"Armed Hands","description":"Lucas and his team are after a gang of Serbian criminals using NATO-issued weapons.

These abductions don&#x2030;&#x42B;&#x404;t usually last more than one day and are characterised by violence. Each year in Europe there are 3,000,000 home raids, one every 10 seconds. In over thirty percent of cases, the family is at home when the raid occurs. The fusion of these two crimes has resulted in a new form of criminal assault in which the robbers not only ransack the houses they break into but also kidnap the family for short periods of time. Family members are then forced to hand over as much money as possible to the assailants. On very few occasions do such attacks end without serious injury. Kidnapped is the story of one of these attacks.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzUzOWYyMjctMjFmNy00NDU1LWJiN2EtMDQ5YzQ3NWU5YjQwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4070908/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":81,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Zak Forsman","nm1768177"]],"escritores":[["Zak Forsman","nm1768177"]],"atores":[["Luis Robledo","nm0733287"],["Adriana Yanez","nm2349366"]]},{"title":"Fun Arrived","description":"A famous Bollywood film star turns into a vampire during Christmas holidays in Goa, India and she sucks blood of young virgin men.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1822219/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":85,"escritores":[["Elvis Rumion","nm4275022"]],"atores":[["Sabrina Schaumburg","nm1889574"]]},{"title":"The Casebook of Eddie Brewer","description":"Eddie Brewer is an old-school paranormal investigator, being followed as part of a documentary .","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MjY3NTk5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU1MDMzNTE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2298489/","userScore":6.5,"voteCount":113,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":89,"budgetUsd":10000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Andrew Spencer","nm1094386"]],"escritores":[["Andrew Spencer","nm1094386"]],"atores":[["Ian Brooker","nm0111770"],["Peter Wight","nm0927835"],["Louise Paris","nm4946541"],["Alison Belbin","nm2133766"],["Phil Blake","nm4948172"],["Erin Connolly","nm6183773"],["Sean Connolly","nm0175355"],["Bella Hamblin","nm0357402"],["Glen Hill","nm4955998"],["Greg Hobbs","nm1279692"],["Sarah Horner","nm1556468"],["Paul Jones","nm5012462"],["Pardip Kumar","nm4948144"],["Robert Lister","nm0514267"],["Paul Magson","nm4956064"],["Rina Mahoney","nm1544411"],["Clare Owen","nm0654108"],["Pablo Raybould","nm3177118"]]},{"title":"The Table","description":"Two friends buy, what looks to be, an antique table before discovering it has a far more sinister purpose.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MTYzOTYyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAyNzY3OA@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2142941/","userScore":6.9,"voteCount":40,"releaseYear":2012,"genres":["Short","Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":5,"diretores":[["Shane Free","nm0293064"]],"escritores":[["Don Free","nm3780616"],["Shane Free","nm0293064"],["Bryan W.
