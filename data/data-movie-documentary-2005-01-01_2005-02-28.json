Not-quite-so-young men fulfil their sexual dreams as protagonists in bareback productions. And, at private sex parties, almost every second guy has either taken part in a porn film or wants to. In 1997, I followed on camera the fortunes of a group of men who had chosen to wok - either artistically or commercially - with their bodies. This footage later become part of my 1998 documentary, SEX/LIFE IN L.A.. I'm still in touch with some of the men in that film, these include: lone battler Kevin Kramer, mature shooting star Cole Tucker, American boy-next-door Matt Bradshaw and friends of the occasional model John Garwood, who died of an overdose in 1998. Some of these men have successful careers behind them, others have left the sex industry altogether. Driven by a sense of adventure or by their narcissism, young men today are still keen to put their own stamp on porn cinema. But the days of a purely non-commercial fulfilment of one's sexual desires has long gone, and the interests of consumers, models and producers no longer coincide. Gay life - like the entire industry - has become something of a profession and is now thoroughly commercialized. Young models begin their sexual careers in internet containers; they enter the business fully aware of their self-exploitation and yet, at the same time, they are somehow unconscious of how they are being exploited. Meanwhile, bareback video producers scout the country in their motorhome on the lookout for new protagonists. But can there be winners in this game? Is there anything left of sex itself? And is there a life after porn?","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMjQzOTU0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk2NTEzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Cycles of Porn: Sex/Life in L.A., Part 2","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445949/","userScore":5.7,"voteCount":151,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":104,"ageRating":"Unrated","diretores":[["Jochen Hick","nm0382569"]],"escritores":[["Jochen Hick","nm0382569"]],"atores":[["Johnny Law","nm1864930"],["Holden Grey","nm1795730"],["Vin Nolan","nm1865365"],["Sergio Anthony","nm1864182"],["Rocky","nm1423779"],["Bastian","nm1771661"],["Corbin Michaels","nm1787604"],["Will West","nm1536903"],["Bill Gardner","nm0306841"],["Ray Butler","nm0962134"],["Kevin Kramer","nm0469587"],["Matt Bradshaw","nm0103508"],["Cole Tucker","nm0875827"],["Damian Ford","nm0285585"],["John Garwood","nm1585135"],["Jay Wheeler","nm1838642"],["Donnie Mauldin","nm1872095"],["Henning von Berg","nm1746544"]]},{"title":"Homo sapiens","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMTMxODcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg1NDUwMjE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443040/","userScore":7.3,"voteCount":193,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":88,"diretores":[["Jacques Malaterre","nm0538977"],["Chip Proser","nm0698734"]],"escritores":[["Yves Coppens","nm0178810"],["Fred Fougea","nm0288263"],["Pierre Pelot","nm0671282"]],"atores":[["Philippe Torreton","nm0868881"],["Mourad Bennefla","nm5355236"],["Natasha Rees-Davies","nm1159189"]]},{"title":"The True Story of Hannibal","description":"One of history's greatest military leaders, at age nine Hannibal accompanied his father Hamilcar Barca on the Carthaginian expedition to conquer Spain. Before embarking, the boy vowed eternal hatred for Rome, his people's bitter rival. Twenty years later, in 218 BC, he left New Carthage (now Cartagena, Spain) to wage war on \"The Eternal City\" with an army of about 40,000, including cavalry and elephants. After crossing the Pyrenees and Rhone River, he traversed the Alps while beset by snowstorms, landslides, and hostile mountain tribes. This 2-hour special brings to life the story of the Carthaginian general who struck fear in all Roman hearts and wreaked havoc with his masterful military tactics, bringing the mighty Roman Republic to the brink of ruin.

In the world of rock climbing and free soloing without a rope, there is only one name that fits all three - John Bachar.

A true rock star as a teenager, he soloed 5.11 when 5.12 didn't exist, created the first 5.12 in Yosemite Valley, bouldered harder, climbed stronger, and refused to compromise his ethics along the way. Then, at the height of his fame, he disappeared.

This film is a genuine overall record of the relocation of Fengjie town in 2002, just before the first water-reserving.

The coup, which took place in front of the film camera and which had a legal aftermath in the County Court, concerned a controversial planning matter that was hammered out during a coffee break, when most of the members were absent. At the beginning of 1997, parts of the traffic route plan for Älvdalen's church village had gained legal force, which meant that the national road that runs through the village was to be widened and equipped with three roundabouts. This in turn meant that the cinema from the beginning of the 20th century, as well as about twenty other houses, would be demolished. The reason for the extensive asphalting of Älvdalen was said to be traffic safety, but financial interests also appeared. But as people began to realize what the plan really meant, opposition grew. Action groups were formed, the contradictions within the political groups hardened and frustration increased.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyNWIxOGItMzk5OS00Yjc1LWFlMDMtZTc1ZWE4ZTFmYmI1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR125,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32432914/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":97,"diretores":[["Erik Strömdahl","nm0835562"]],"escritores":[["Erik Strömdahl","nm0835562"]],"atores":[["Erik Strömdahl","nm0835562"],["Gunnar Barke","nm16167042"],["Lennart Hed","nm16167038"],["Ulf Segrell","nm16167043"],["Thomas Almgren","nm16167049"],["Inger Björk","nm16167050"],["Arne Bogghed","nm16167051"],["Mats Brolin","nm12999082"],["Bo Bävertoft","nm16167052"],["Anita Del Nero","nm16167054"],["Emanuel Del Nero","nm16167053"],["Getrrud Edqvist","nm16167055"],["Jill Engström","nm16167045"],["Anne-Marie Eriksson","nm16167048"],["Margit Eriksson","nm16167047"],["Torbjörn Eriksson","nm16167040"],["Herbert Halvarsson","nm16167044"],["S-E Johansson","nm16167039"]]},{"title":"Profils paysans: le quotidien","description":"Second documentary of a trilogy produced on the long term (together with Profils paysans: l'approche (2001) and Modern Life (2008)), showing the simple lives of farmers in contemporary Southern France.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI2YWViNWMtNTRjOC00NjI5LWI0Y2YtYmRkNmI3MTYyYzc4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442424/","userScore":7.5,"voteCount":141,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":83,"diretores":[["Raymond Depardon","nm0220019"]],"escritores":[["Raymond Depardon","nm0220019"]],"atores":[["Marcel Privat","nm2353260"],["Raymond Privat","nm2352101"],["Alain Rouvière","nm2355153"],["Monique Rouvière","nm2349596"],["Marcelle Brès","nm2354839"],["Jean-François Pantel","nm2356620"],["Guy Douchy","nm2696003"],["Louis Brès","nm2351962"],["Marc Toureilles","nm2695151"],["Jean-Pierre Nizet","nm2694384"],["Paulette Maneval","nm2351629"],["Robert Maneval","nm2349257"],["Amandine Gagnaire","nm2694709"],["Michel Valla","nm2693117"],["Claudia Boittin","nm2694253"],["Nicolas Boittin","nm2692951"],["Paul Argaud","nm2353371"],["Marcel Challaye","nm2698034"]]},{"title":"Gregory Crewdson: The Aesthetics of Repression","description":"Meticulously setting up each cinematic shot, Gregory Crewdson has mastered a style of eerie realism intended the make the regular feel foreign.

Much like a film director, Crewdson achieves his startling images by working with a professional crew including a director of photography, a camera operator, a production designer, actors and a casting director. His astonishingly elaborate sets create a unique realm of mise-en-scène, inspired largely by the works of American artists and film directors.

Jaymo, an aspiring filmmaker, suddenly finds himself homeless and living out of his car. Desperate to find his way out, he begins shooting a documentary about the overlooked homeless people in this sharply divided society. When he meets a mysterious bum named Clem, Jaymo realizes that every homeless person has a cart full of secrets and a unique story of personal collapse to tell. Together they embark on a classic American road trip to different cities to meet and understand more about the forgotten homeless people that struggle to live on and find contentment on the streets of America. Their eye-opening journey through the supposedly glamorous United States culminates in Nashville, where Clem seeks his ultimate revenge against the unscrupulous banker that caused his fall from grace. The soundtrack is a riveting mix of original songs performed entirely by the street musicians that the filmmakers meet as they traveled across America.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MjQyMzEzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA5OTk1MDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR1,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359389/","userScore":6.3,"voteCount":8,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Comedy","Documentary","Drama","Family"],"runtimeMin":90,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Erich Lyttle","nm1346769"]],"atores":[["Kris Jamieson","nm1348064"],["Clem Weredail","nm1347782"],["Danny Bruno","nm0116461"],["Tony Lozito","nm0523661"]]},{"title":"The Shield: Breaking Episode 315","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZhMmFjMDktN2QzMy00YjQ4LTg2ZDItNWE5NzJjOTVlN2M1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR46,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445936/","userScore":2.6,"voteCount":135,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":80,"diretores":[["Marc Ostrick","nm1192535"]],"escritores":[["Marc Ostrick","nm1192535"]],"atores":[["Jules Fleming","nm1778366"],["André 3000","nm0071275"],["Scott Brazil","nm0106368"],["Cathy Cahlin Ryan","nm1108664"],["Michael Chiklis","nm0004821"],["Catherine Dent","nm0219748"],["Charles H.

Unlike previous documentaries on the subject, Spione examines the impending demise of the farm where his Mom grew up as the result not of economic trends or political pressures, but rather, the increasingly strained intergenerational dynamics between family members. With extraordinary plain-spoken candor, the Ames family reveals how callous parenting and diverging religious views may have led an entire generation to turn away from the family tradition. On the other hand, the film makes abundantly clear that the work itself is still a back-breaking grind, a difficult path for even the hardiest farmer's son to follow, even in the era of air-conditioned tractor cabs. A powerful evocation of a vanishing way of life, and a moving tribute to the rare character it takes to persevere on a small American farm.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MzMwODA5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA3NzAzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,3,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458317/","userScore":6.8,"voteCount":13,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["James Spione","nm0819011"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"The Brits Backstage","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446662/","userScore":7,"voteCount":15,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"runtimeMin":30,"diretores":[["Matthew Amos","nm0025316"]],"atores":[["Kate Thornton","nm0861550"],["Billie Joe Armstrong","nm0035626"],["Daniel Bedingfield","nm1286662"],["Natasha Bedingfield","nm1599769"],["Tom Chaplin","nm1758290"],["Minnie Driver","nm0000378"],["Chris Evans","nm0262632"],["Jenni Falconer","nm0266009"],["Tom Fletcher","nm1624232"],["Bob Geldof","nm0002097"],["Jamelia","nm1478388"],["Jodie Kidd","nm0452249"],["Lemar","nm1327760"],["Ana Matronic","nm1615480"],["Brian May","nm0006190"],["Davina McCall","nm0564635"],["Kelly Osbourne","nm1114884"],["Sharon Osbourne","nm0651769"]]},{"title":"The Beatles: Love Me Do","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY4NTBiOGYtMGUwOC00NjAzLTk4MjYtMDVhMmIwZDgyZGUwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2442628/","userScore":5.3,"voteCount":22,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":90,"diretores":[["Richard Driscoll","nm0238051"]],"escritores":[["Richard Driscoll","nm0238051"]],"atores":[["The Beatles","nm1397313"],["George Harrison","nm0365600"],["John Lennon","nm0006168"],["Paul McCartney","nm0005200"],["Tony Sheridan","nm0792270"],["Victor Spinetti","nm0818920"],["Ringo Starr","nm0823592"]]},{"title":"Igor Stravinsky: Composer","description":"The life and work of one of the most influential composers of the 20th Century: Igor Stravinsky, narrated by himself.

It examines the national and international grass roots response to an epidemic that has already overshadowed the Black Death in terms of human lives lost. The demand for access to affordable treatment for 40 million people living with HIV, most of whom live in poor countries, represents one of the most successful political movements of contemporary history. This documentary examines critical junctures in the battle for access to HIV treatment as the poorest and most marginalized individuals confront larger powers, including governments, corporate bodies and a multinational drug industry that is motivated by profit. The fight for AIDS drugs is taking place in tandem with a growing anti-globalization movement; the latter provides a backdrop for examining AIDS through a lens of poverty, socioeconomic injustice and human rights. At the heart of this documentary is a thorny question: Can the world afford universal HIV treatment? At what cost? What will be the global cost if we fail to treat and save 40 million people now?

On that day, two rival outlaw biker clubs, the Comancheros and the Bandidos, engaged in open warfare at the Viking Tavern. After a violent shoot-out in the pub car park in full view of terrified members of the public, six bikers and a 15-year-old girl lay dead. Film maker Martin Brown has had a rich and varied career in the entertainment industry including a 10-year association with BAFTA winning director Baz Luhrmann as art director for Strictly Ballroom, co-producer of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet and lead producer of Moulin Rouge. Brown knows there is a \"gripping human story\" behind the Milperra Massacre and he plans to tell this story in a multi-million dollar feature film titled 'Brothers in Arms'. 1% One Percenters follows Brown's perilous journey as he tries to uncover the truth about what happened on that fatal day. Until now this event has been off limits to film makers. 1% One Percenters trails Brown as he searches for the right director, the right screenwriter and enough funds to bring the true story about Milperra to the big screen. Among the people Brown meets are Comanchero president and Milperra survivor 'Jock' Ross, Bandido vice president 'Bullets', Bandido Milperra survivor 'Porky', Lee Denholm, the girlfriend of 'Snodgrass' the Bandido leader at Milperra, ex Bandido Milperra survivor 'Caesar' Campbell and investigating police officer ex superintendent Ron Stephenson. Witnessing these meetings, the documentary is able to reveal the story behind Milperra for the first time on television. By documenting his journey and incorporating archive film of the massacre and interviews with bikers, witnesses and police 1% One Percenters Search For A Screenplay provides a unique insight into one of the seminal events in Australian social history","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449552/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"diretores":[["Don Featherstone","nm1067861"]],"atores":[["Caesar Campbell","nm1851316"],["Lee Denholm","nm1846623"],["Jason Kent","nm2173872"],["Jock Ross","nm1851588"],["Hud Saunders","nm3190362"]]},{"title":"A Tattoo on My Heart: The Warriors of Wounded Knee 1973","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2102258/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":56,"diretores":[["Charles Abourezk","nm2643814"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Looking for a Thrill: An Anthology of Inspiration","description":"Looking For a Thrill: An Anthology of Inspiration is a collection of personal stories about defining moments of musical inspiration (a record, a show, a musician, etc.) for 112 musicians who themselves have inspired so many.

It boasts the largest historic district in the United States, glorious Hudson River views around every corner, and a stunning array of historical Victorian architecture. Almost 50 years later, it has slid to NY state's \"Most Violent City\" status. Drugs and crime run rampant. Some people blame past events, others focus on the recent administration, during which $380,000 was wire transferred to friends of the mayor. Bumper stickers reading \"Honest Mayor Wanted: Apply Newburgh, NY\" started popping up around the city. An underground website was started, attacking both the politics and personal issues. The heated political climate led to a firey campaign for mayor in 2003. The film follows the four candidates running for mayor, as well as some of the higher profile citizens as they 'fight' for change. The film climaxes with the selection of the city's new mayor, and the open-ended question of weather or not this Hudson River city will finally be saved.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5Njc5MjE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg0ODIzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR14,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426567/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":103,"budgetUsd":100000,"diretores":[["Merle Becker","nm0065527"]],"atores":[["Andrew Marino","nm1698187"],["Nick Valentine","nm0884285"],["Regina Angelo","nm1728204"],["Sal Cracolici","nm1727114"],["Emily Metaxas","nm1728706"],["Michael Gabor","nm1731841"]]},{"title":"Call It Democracy","description":"Explores the controversial 2000 U.S. presidential election between George W.

Tijuana Jews is an authentic and living testimony set against conceptions and misconceptions of this near-mythic border city. Throughout the early 20th century, thousands of European Jews sailed to America to escape persecution and look for new opportunities. Some arrived in Mexico, and a small group made their way north to Tijuana. The Tijuana Jewish community was established by immigrants and their descendants from Eastern Europe-Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews from countries like Poland, Russia, Lithuania, and Rumania. And also by Sephardic Jews from Turkey, Greece, and the Balkans and by Arabic Jews from Syria and Lebanon. Tijuana Jews illuminates the experiences of local pioneers who established the first Jewish temple in Tijuana and subsequent congregations, including Maguen David, The Hatikvah, and the Centro Social Israelita de Tijuana. For the film's director, Tijuana was also a place for weddings and bar mitzvahs and helping out at his father's store on Revolution Avenue. The first-person narration takes the audience on an intimate journey that builds to a dynamic present that includes the transformation of Tijuana into the busiest border crossing in the world, and the migration of many Tijuana Jewish families to America. Tijuana Jews is a personal exploration of this unique community, which blended Jewish and Mexican cultures and customs in an unlikely place and time.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDUwMTUwZDgtNmQ3Yi00OTMxLTgwMWYtMjZiZGE0YTYxMGE1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758938/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":52,"diretores":[["Isaac Artenstein","nm0037683"]],"escritores":[["Isaac Artenstein","nm0037683"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"The Theme of Creation: An Exploration of Meher Baba's 'God Speaks'","description":"Adapted from Meher Baba's 1955 book, 'God Speaks,' The Theme of Creation explores the origin of the universe, evolution, and the purpose of all life.

Part Two: Building the System In its early decades, the U.S. Forest Service had to invent the tools and policies needed to manage public lands. Natural and social disasters including catastrophic fires and the Great Depression had a powerful influence on the young agency. Part Three: Boom! World War II transformed the nation, as well as the U.S. Forest Service. The agency shifted from a stewardship role, caring for the land, to the role of production, fulfilling postwar demands. This was the time when the multiple use concept was put into action, and also the time when conflicts began to develop among competing interests. Part Four: The Greatest Good? With a more outspoken public and increased environmental activism challenging the interests of logging and ranching communities, the Forest Service found it difficult to determine the greatest good. A new scientific understanding of ecosystems helped form a vision for public land management that continues to evolve and guide the U.S. Forest Service.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRlNGNkZDctYmVkMS00NWQ1LTlhODgtODY1ZWU4NWVkZjU0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR136,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452626/","userScore":7.1,"voteCount":19,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","History"],"runtimeMin":120,"diretores":[["Steve Dunsky","nm1878299"],["Dave Steinke","nm1874084"]],"escritores":[["Steve Dunsky","nm1878299"],["Stephen Most","nm1713436"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Plum Blossom in Snow","description":"A portrait of Australian citizen Zhizhen \"Jane\" Dai, whose husband was persecuted and murdered for his belief in Falun Gong, an ancient meditative practice that enjoyed a revival in China in the 1990's.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7110284/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":51,"diretores":[["Elefteria Kalogritsa","nm0436165"]],"escritores":[["Elefteria Kalogritsa","nm0436165"]],"atores":[["Georges-Henri Beauthier","nm1960743"],["Fadu Chen","nm9113805"],["Zhizhen 'Jane' Dai","nm9113804"]]},{"title":"Liquid Vinyl","description":"Superstar DJs discuss the history, culture, technology, spirituality and the future of electronic dance music - the music that catapulted the Club DJ to \"rock star\" status and united dance floors across the globe.

For Mario (38), dancing is a stage, complete with mirror ball and laser show, where he hopes to forget his lack of employment and be somebody. Reinhard (62) is in search of himself and a rather more spiritual way of dancing - in self-help groups and express-yourself-through-dancing ensembles. His dancing began when he watched the movie Alexis Sorbas. The film encouraged him to accept his personal destiny.

After the first boom of the 70's, skateboarding had been ignored by society, leaving it to small groups of passionate diehards to keep skating alive. A small revival occurred in 1985 due to its association with films such as \"Back To The Future\" and other influences from America. This wave began to gain international exposure and spawned the opening of a few new skate parks. Yet once more during the 90's, due to lack of organization and falling revenues, skate parks closed, magazines folded and people lost interest. Attitudes within skater culture had become less communal. Skateboarding went back underground. Today skateboarding has come back with a vengeance, .across the Atlantic, commercial momentum was steadily building through the late 90's, exemplified by televised events such as 'The X-Games' and the ubiquitous 'Tony Hawk Pro Skater' Playstation video game., skateboarding has come full circle and is returning to its roots, so that negative trendy attitudes give way to an 'anything is cool' atmosphere, like in its earliest days. Skateboarding's legacy is now also consumed every day by the corporate non-skateboarding world, in music, TV, fashion, design and advertising, yet skaters themselves feel left out, ironically victims of their own success. Rollin' Through the Decades encapsulates the positive atmosphere of skateboarding and shows a true picture of its influence on our time. Showcasing historic, rare and unseen skateboarding footage. Featuring some of the finest tunes from the 80s and 90s and music especially composed for the film. ROLLIN interviews over 100 inspirational and legendary skateboarders, photographers and filmmakers.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0Njc1NzMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDczODM5Nw@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR120,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460554/","userScore":8.6,"voteCount":22,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Sport"],"runtimeMin":120,"budgetUsd":150000,"diretores":[["Winstan Whitter","nm1267396"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Stolen Lives","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884836/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":49,"diretores":[["Takahiro Hamano","nm1458780"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Gaia Selene: Saving the Earth by Colonizing the Moon","description":"Our future and the earth itself are in danger from pollution, global warming, climate change and a looming energy crisis.

Saarinen's landmark terminal suggested that any place, even one occupied for a brief moment, even one not intended as a final destination, could be forever imbedded in our memory. Built at a time when commercial travel was transitioning from propeller to jet aircraft, the iconic terminal was destined for a future that would never arrive. Since 2001, the site has remained in a state of suspension, and it is this phenomenon that serves as the platform for an international exhibition of contemporary art, Terminal 5. While the terminal stands as a vacant masterpiece of air travel, the Terminal 5 exhibition is intended to further the public encounter with the airport, contributing to an enriched understanding of travel, architecture and contemporary art. As a project for the early 21st century it offers a new model for responding to existing resources in public space by providing an experience that privileges a unique moment in time.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWY5MTJiZGEtYTMxMS00ODA3LWEyMTctNDlhMjRjM2IyNjUxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454965/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":90,"diretores":[["Joseph Arnao","nm0036011"],["Martin Fisher","nm1897080"]],"atores":[["Eero Saarinen","nm8060213"]]},{"title":"Rivers of Giants","description":"Africa is a land of giants.

It follows the story of loggers and conservationists thrown into conflict as the timber resource of the region runs out and the remaining old-growth forests are targeted by government forest managers. The films shows the incompetence of the government managers, a corrupt logging industry and the manipulation and exploitation of forestry politics and workers jobs by a self-interested logging union. The film was nominated as 1 of 5 best Australian documentaries of 2005. It was directed by Peter Vaughan, Producers, Russell Hawkins and Toby Patten, Executive Producers, Michael McManon and Tony Ayers, Editor Jane Usher, Script Writer Rosie Jones and P Vaughan. Music and sound design Jamie Saxe. During production of the film, Peter Rutherford, the General Manager of the government logging agency Forestry Victoria, made attempts to stop its completion by initiating a series of malicious criminal charges against the Director. At the trial the government suddenly withdrew all charges after the judge criticised the political nature of the prosecution. The judge also levelled serious criticism against the Forestry Victoria, General Manager, Peter Rutherford, for initiating what he described as a malicious prosecution, and an abuse of authority. Vaughan's outstanding legal team consisted of barrister Klaus Mueller, and solicitor Vanessa Bleyer. Rutherford was later overlooked for the role of managing the new government logging agency VicForests, a decision attributed to the progressive Environment Minister John Thwaits. After his fall from grace, Rutherford found a job working for a Japanese wood-chip mill at Eden NSW, where he became infamous for posting vicious, self-narrated, hate-videos, focusing upon local female conservationists opposed to the clear-fell logging of the Southern Forests by agents for the chip-mill - The Last Valley was one of Australia's last publicly funded independent investigative environmental documentaries, before political interference within SBS and ABC dumbed-down the production of documentary into cooking and lifestyle content.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11730452/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"budgetUsd":200000,"diretores":[["Peter Vaughan","nm11326798"]],"escritores":[["Rosie Jones","nm0429181"],["Peter Vaughan","nm11326798"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Il viaggio del führer in Italia","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8232524/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":1000000,"diretores":[["Leonardo Tiberi","nm3377186"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"In a Nutshell: A Portrait of Elizabeth Tashjian","description":"Some three years in the making, In a Nutshell is a documentary on Elizabeth Yegsa Tashjian -- a one-time concert violinist, heralded artist, Christian Science healer, late TV celebrity and founder of the Nut Museum in Old Lyme, Connecticut.

It was a true \"ethnic cleansing\", carried out with a series of massacres of civilians and military personnel (many thrown into the foibe), started in Istria and Dalmatia in 1943 after the armistice of September 8 and completed in May 1945 in then, when the troops of the former Yugoslavia invaded all Venice Giulia then to Udine. This story, made up of horrors, sacrifices and heroisms of simple people, torn from the most memorable memories of places inhabited for centuries by Italian populations, has for fifty years been totally forgotten and concealed for generations and the public opinion of the country . This is a series of two episodes in which those events are rebuilt with authentic cinematic footage, with precious repertoire footage and with the help of over 100 testimonies of high emotion, of men and women who have experienced those dramatic events. The documentary also uses the authoritative contribution of Paolo Mieli and Gianni Oliva.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRlZTFmMWItNmVmYi00NzEzLTlmNTEtOGVhNzQ2YTE3Y2I0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR7,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470046/","userScore":8.2,"voteCount":8,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":50,"diretores":[["Nicolò Bongiorno","nm0094468"]],"escritores":[["Alex Luria","nm1778615"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"It's a Good Day: The Making of 'Around the Bend'","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDhkNzBlNDAtNWJjZS00ZDRiLTgwY2MtOGJlZDcyMGQ2MWUzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR99,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463327/","userScore":7.7,"voteCount":45,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":51,"diretores":[["Mark Rance","nm0709411"]],"atores":[["Michael Becker","nm1922512"],["Michael Bilog","nm0082648"],["Jonah Bobo","nm1501050"],["Françoise Bonnot","nm0095089"],["Theodore Y.

In candid unscripted interviews with teenage runaways and kids who chose to get clean and sober, real addiction and rehab stories from people in all walks of life, including a former Miss Hawaii, offer insights into the tragedy of drug addiction and the personal choices one can make. \"Life or Meth\" is the second of two hard-hitting and impactful documentary films on the drug problems that plague every major city including beautiful Hawai'i. This film and \" ICE_ Hawaii's Crystal Meth Epidemic\" were simulcast on all major Hawaiian stations throughout the state for maximum impact. Both films have been utilized successfully in the work place as teaching tools and in schools, communities, and on federal reservations and rehab centers.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTNiYmU3NmUtOThlYy00ZDEzLWJkZGUtMTMzM2ZlNmVjZGU3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8005568/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":58,"diretores":[["Edgy Lee","nm0497207"]],"escritores":[["Edgy Lee","nm0497207"],["Jeff Mueller","nm9628446"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Danser med Drenge: Hallo hvor det koger","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451695/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"runtimeMin":180,"atores":[["Morten Bolvig","nm1588180"],["Maria Bramsen","nm1095474"],["Klaus Kjellerup","nm1210054"],["Anne-Dorthe Michelsen","nm1203538"],["Henrik Stanley Møller","nm1588583"],["Steffen Qwist","nm1588661"],["Rie Rasmussen","nm1592415"],["Jan Sivertsen","nm0803387"]]},{"title":"Victims with Disabilities: The Forensic Interview","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466503/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":56,"budgetUsd":200000,"diretores":[["Greg Byers","nm0125813"]],"escritores":[["Greg Byers","nm0125813"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Diliman","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467875/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":77,"diretores":[["Mes De Guzman","nm1336304"]],"escritores":[["Albert Banzon","nm2009282"]],"atores":[["Ermie Concepcion","nm0174239"],["Perry Dizon","nm2015658"],["Rona Montebon","nm2009866"],["Ronnie Quizon","nm1368677"],["Cris Villanueva","nm0897903"],["Solomon Villanueva","nm2006648"]]},{"title":"Blue Carpet Special: Joe Kid on a Stingray","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0856773/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"diretores":[["Sean Osborne","nm0651745"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Absolute Pressed Ham","description":"Artist, Cosimo Cavallaro throws three hundred pounds of pressed ham on a bed in a Manhattan gallery.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1540747/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short","Drama"],"runtimeMin":13,"diretores":[["Sarah Lee Jacobs","nm3680875"]],"atores":[["Cosimo Cavallaro","nm3676578"],["Sarah Cavallaro","nm3698793"],["Benjamin Rosen","nm2576809"]]},{"title":"Saving the World","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7763788/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":55,"budgetUsd":50000,"diretores":[["Maija Blåfield","nm2943850"]],"escritores":[["Maija Blåfield","nm2943850"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"La soupe culturelle - La soupe magique","description":"Oettli's film follows a cultural exchange program between actors from Burkina Faso and a Swiss director touring through both countries.

Norman Kaye and Paul Cox first met in Melbourne in 1967.

So began a 36-year working relationship that ceased only as the curtains of Alzheimer's Disease gradually closed around Kaye. There are few films by Paul Cox that are without some significant contribution, on-screen or off, by Kaye. Whether as lead actor or in a supporting role; as composer or performer, Kaye influenced everyone around him with guileless enthusiasm and humour. The Remarkable Mr Kaye includes film extracts and personal memories in a moving film that is homage to friendship and a creative partnership that shaped and changed Paul Cox's life.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBmMzU3YWEtMTdlMy00ZTNjLTg5YTUtZDkxZTM4MDVlMTg5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866072/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Biography"],"runtimeMin":49,"diretores":[["Paul Cox","nm0185187"]],"atores":[["Norman Kaye","nm0443367"],["Paul Cox","nm0185187"]]},{"title":"Ein Kind um jeden Preis","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3607820/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Valentin Thurn","nm3218495"]],"escritores":[["Valentin Thurn","nm3218495"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Del roig al blau","description":"A series of interviews to relevant personalities who lived the valencian transition to democracy.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E1NDVkZTQtYzNiMC00MTUxLWE0OTktZmU4YjVkOTc1MGNlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR2,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482247/","userScore":7.9,"voteCount":17,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":97,"diretores":[["Llorenç Soler","nm0812962"]],"escritores":[["Àlex Crespo","nm2050327"],["Albert Montón","nm2056822"]],"atores":[["Joan Fuster","nm0299383"]]},{"title":"Bra Wars: Boom or Bust","description":"Bra design has reflected the evolution of femininity since Victorian whale boned corsets.

They will do this on a stage, in front of a live audience, with Mr. Malkovich directing all the action. He will also direct the 3 camera's of the Fashion Television crew as they film the event. The Hollywood star has 3 days to pull this unusual spectacle together. The tv crew follows Mr. Malkovich as he oversees fittings, tries to choreograph a group of Italian fighters, and drives to the factory where his clothes are manufactured . Along the way, we learn of his mother's agorophobia; that his children think he's a loser, and the voracious eating habits of his wife. This one hour 'documentary' also features Mr. Malkovich's thoughts on life as a celebrity; examples of his superior driving skills, and the ongoing mystery of the 'lost pants'. Told from the point of view of the bewildered Producer (Howard Brull/Fashion Television), we are never quite sure if this entire production is actually going to work, or end as an embarrassing failure.

A journey in time and space between France and Hungary, between the past and the present. The first railway station evokes mourning over a lost and unforgettable father, leaving behind a feeling of emptiness and the desire to embark on the journey. The itinerary: to tell people what has remained to be seen, memories and feelings, some of which you are aware of, some of which you are not. Having encountered the Jewish Hungarians roots and becoming familiarized with their language during this journey you will come back changed. Encounters with a culture, places, faces, memories and forgetting mould you into a new person.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY5Mjg3NDgtYjE3MS00ZTU1LWI4MDItNGIwOTEyY2I5YjVkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR90,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0989612/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Barbara Spitzer","nm2598077"]],"atores":[["Ferenc Fejtö","nm2597855"],["Gerald Spitzer","nm2595457"],["Barbara Spitzer","nm2598077"]]},{"title":"Heathenology","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452791/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Music","Documentary"],"runtimeMin":120,"budgetUsd":20000,"diretores":[["Steve Jaggi","nm1863720"]],"atores":[["Malcolm Dome","nm1854596"],["Lionel Hicks","nm1860028"],["Tony Ritchie","nm1860171"],["Pete Southern","nm1860216"]]},{"title":"En plein Caubère","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAwN2Q1MGMtY2ViMy00ZTE0LThlOWUtMzk2Mzk0NWY0NTE3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442204/","userScore":8.4,"voteCount":10,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":90,"diretores":[["Anne-Laure Brénéol","nm1584406"]],"atores":[["Philippe Caubère","nm0146431"]]},{"title":"Samanvay: In Harmony","description":"Samanvay..that's the name of his ashram.

They have lived in the same rent-controlled apartment in Long Island City, Queens for more than half a century. He drinks too much and hardly works, rationalizing that he has to care for his mother. She is a devout Catholic Irish immigrant who does not really understand the way things in the neighborhood are changing or what is the matter with her son. He does indeed help take care of her, and she needs someone around the house but the way she and her son bicker is highly disturbing. The paradox is that he can barely take care of himself, so the mother and son still have a tight bond despite its inherent dysfunctionality. A portrait of two depressed individuals attempting to peter out their last years in urban poverty, \"The Kelleys\" portrays Mrs. Kelley with her longing for the past and Greg's tough guy tirades, arguing, helping each other out and trying to navigate day to day life in an increasingly expensive and uncaring world.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwOTAzODA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQwMDc2Mg@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR93,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1419547/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":24,"budgetUsd":5000,"diretores":[["Jon Wetterau","nm3416911"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"UK Radio Aid","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448827/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":50,"atores":[["Matt Brown","nm5365392"],["Katy Hill","nm0384441"],["Bryan Adams","nm0001898"],["Gem Archer","nm1108344"],["Richard Bacon","nm0045820"],["Zoë Ball","nm0050493"],["Simon Bates","nm0061031"],["Tony Blackburn","nm0085650"],["Tony Blair","nm0086363"],["Melanie C","nm0004822"],["Jon Culshaw","nm0191708"],["Jason Donovan","nm0232997"],["Chris Evans","nm0262632"],["Leigh Francis","nm0290227"],["Liam Gallagher","nm0302427"],["Ricky Gervais","nm0315041"],["Mark Goodier","nm0328933"],["Jade Goody","nm1197669"]]},{"title":"Les últimes hores","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY2YzRkOGUtOWFmMC00NDQyLThlNjUtM2EzNzM0OTBmNGY3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13989442/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":30000,"diretores":[["Jordi Call","nm2199822"]],"escritores":[["Jordi Call","nm2199822"],["Nuria Pujolàs","nm12295255"]],"atores":[["Marina Boj","nm12295254"],["Nuria Pujolàs","nm12295255"]]},{"title":"Kilroy: Behind the Tan","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445497/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"atores":[["Emeka Onono","nm1845750"],["Robert Kilroy-Silk","nm1090236"],["Jan Beech","nm15474132"],["Godfrey Bloom","nm6075566"],["Nigel Farage","nm2234341"],["Glenys Kinnock","nm1572560"],["Neil Kinnock","nm0455786"],["Roger Knapman","nm15474133"],["Alessandra Mussolini","nm0615905"]]},{"title":"Erik(A) - Der Mann, der Weltmeisterin wurde","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q0ODMyNzAtM2YwMC00NmJhLWEzOGUtZGQ2ZTc5OGY3Y2I4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443741/","userScore":6.1,"voteCount":18,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":86,"diretores":[["Kurt Mayer","nm0562446"]],"escritores":[["Hanne Lassl","nm1823369"]],"atores":[["Erik Schinegger","nm1822539"],["Christa Schinegger","nm1823081"],["Erika Schinegger","nm1823082"],["Claire Sybrecht","nm1823135"],["Renate Neubacher","nm1823004"],["Hermann Gamon","nm1822188"],["Marielle Goitschel","nm1754101"],["Traudl Hecher-Görgl","nm1822875"],["Karl-Heinz Klee","nm1822301"],["Michael Kuhn","nm1821716"],["Rosemarie Male","nm1822963"],["Hans Naglreiter","nm1822407"],["Ernst Raas","nm1822488"],["Christian Radmayr","nm1822489"],["Olga Scartezzini-Pall","nm1823080"],["Karl Schranz","nm1824686"],["Stefan Sodat","nm1822573"],["Heidi Strasser-Zimmermann","nm1823121"]]},{"title":"Esodo - L'Italia dimenticata","description":"Between 1943 and 1954, 350,000 Italians had to abandon their native land in the provinces - then Italian - of Pula, Rijeka and Zara, to escape the persecution and the process of streamlining those territories by the Yugoslav regime established by Marshal Tito. It was a true \"ethnic cleansing\", carried out with a series of massacres of civilians and military personnel (many thrown into the foibe), started in Istria and Dalmatia in 1943 after the armistice of September 8 and completed in May 1945 in then, when the troops of the former Yugoslavia invaded all Venice Giulia then to Udine. This story, made up of horrors, sacrifices and heroisms of simple people, torn from the most memorable memories of places inhabited for centuries by Italian populations, has for fifty years been totally forgotten and concealed for generations and the public opinion of the country . This is a series of two episodes in which those events are rebuilt with authentic cinematic footage, with precious repertoire footage and with the help of over 100 testimonies of high emotion, of men and women who have experienced those dramatic events. The documentary also uses the authoritative contribution of Paolo Mieli and Gianni Oliva.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRkMzRlYmMtMmI1YS00ZDcxLTk1YzYtMTEzOGVmMjdkMTBmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1384771/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"diretores":[["Nicolò Bongiorno","nm0094468"]],"escritores":[["Alex Luria","nm1778615"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"La escena","description":"What is \"la escena\" (the scene) and what is its importance, if any?

The show reveals amazing facts, among them: Kurt Cobain made only $31,000 in 1991, the year Nevermind broke; at the time of his death in 1994, his estate was worth $100 million in future royalties. Over $25 million in legal fees have been spent fighting over ownership of Jimi Hendrix's recordings. And Jim Morrison's estate is controlled by a couple that he had only met a few times. This second installment of Fortune Files will demonstrate that when it comes to celebrity and money, the end is just the beginning.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1033584/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"diretores":[["Melissa Jo Peltier","nm0671318"]],"escritores":[["Christopher Meindl","nm0576880"]],"atores":[["Cornell Womack","nm1870243"]]},{"title":"Southern Exposure: Locations in 'the Notebook'","originalTitle":"Southern Exposure: Locations in 'The Notebook'","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1283949/","userScore":6,"voteCount":9,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short","Drama","Romance"],"runtimeMin":12,"diretores":[["Karina Friend Buck","nm0118383"]],"escritores":[["Karina Friend Buck","nm0118383"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"The Many Faces of Catwoman","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA1ZWI4OWMtZTcyZC00MmU1LTkxOTItZjY3ZWU3MGM1N2ZkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR155,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443114/","userScore":6.7,"voteCount":104,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":30,"diretores":[["Jeffrey Lerner","nm1139932"]],"atores":[["Eartha Kitt","nm0457755"],["Suzan Colòn","nm2028205"],["Alex Ross","nm1661824"],["Paul Levitz","nm1321652"],["Jeph Loeb","nm0517188"],["Dan DiDio","nm0225814"],["Bob Schreck","nm1060552"],["Julie Newmar","nm0628325"],["Lee Meriwether","nm0580886"],["Adam West","nm0001842"],["Sam Strangis","nm0833407"],["Adrienne Barbeau","nm0000105"],["Michelle Pfeiffer","nm0000201"],["Tim Burton","nm0000318"],["Halle Berry","nm0000932"],["Edward L.

The wheels of progress roll onwards, but two middle-aged people get left behind, Maija and Pentti Junkkonen. The small municipality of Oulunsalo is planning factories, business parks, and a new 4-lane road which would cut through the farmers' fields. The old ways of making a living are dying. The oldest daughter, director Mervi Junkkonen, realizes that she herself is part of the reason why her parents decided to give up their livelihood-there is no one to take over the farm. Through her father's 8mm films, she catches glimpses of the farm's history and a time when it was full of life. Now, Pentti (60), spends his time with his collection of tractors and some small-scale farming, but Maija (55) doesn't know what to do. Yet, life keeps taking tragic turns and old worries do not seem so important any more. About a Farm is the director's personal inquiry into a vanishing life-style and a history of which she is the last link.

In the ritual, certain foods are prepared for the ceremonial table in order to honor the ghosts of the ancestors. One of the preferred food items is octopus, an expensive item in China. The Koreans have found a way of sharing this unaffordable item by handing it around amongst the neighbors for the ceremony. At the end of the day when all the rituals have ended, the octopus which has made its day's round of the Korean households in the neighborhood, is left shriveled up and dried out. Octopus is thus a symbol of the pains of economic hardship that accompanies the lives of ethnic minority and the weaker race.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjFmYmNlYjctMzdlNC00ZmJjLWEyMDItZTlkMDgyNjI2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4087938/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Biography","Drama"],"runtimeMin":70,"budgetUsd":250000,"diretores":[["Seewoo Kim","nm5445317"]],"escritores":[["Seewoo Kim","nm5445317"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Sweet Memories Garden Centre","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDYyZDE0NjctZTcxNy00M2VmLTg2NmUtNjM0ZTU1YzRjNmJlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR1,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6881322/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":58,"diretores":[["Simon Klose","nm5205122"]],"escritores":[["Ariel Gomar","nm8988095"],["Simon Klose","nm5205122"]],"atores":[["Bongo di Papa","nm8988091"],["Pule Malungwane","nm8988088"],["Twish Malungwane","nm8988087"],["Thokozani Mthiyane","nm8988093"],["Khosi Simelane","nm8988094"],["Sipho Sithole","nm8988089"],["R.

He didn't see anyone and walked towards where he thought the sound came from. A moment later, a shell hit the ground where he had just been standing. From that moment on, Brossa wanted to be a poet. After the war, Barcelona was \"a desert of expectations\", according to the philosopher Arnau Puig. Franco's dictatorship had put an end to all freedom. No expectation was possible anymore. But Brossa and his friends Antoni Tàpies, Modesto Cuixart, Ponç and Arnau Puig founded a group they called Dau al Set: dice seven. Of course you can never throw a seven and that's what they wanted, in all their youthful recklessness: the impossible. In 1948, Brossa wrote the script for a short film. He was crazy about film, but didn't know anything about the practice of making films. Film was magic for Brossa. Lluis Riera was to be director and the other friends were to play roles. But the film was never made and the script appeared about 50 years later to mark the hundredth anniversary of film in a book called Anthologie du Cinéma Invisible, by Christian Janicot.

With distribution finally secured - four years after pre-production began - everything did, at last, work out.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424072/","userScore":9,"voteCount":18,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":27,"diretores":[["Paul DeNigris","nm1366756"]],"escritores":[["Paul DeNigris","nm1366756"]],"atores":[["Steve Briscoe","nm1443273"],["Matt Crocker","nm0188368"],["Ken Dapper","nm1384629"],["Laura DeNigris","nm1463066"],["Michael DeNigris","nm1132133"],["Paul DeNigris","nm1366756"],["Brad Doan","nm1472536"],["Tiny Glover","nm1501174"],["David Gray","nm1491911"],["J.

How can we heal the damage done to civilians and civil society in places like Iraq and Afghanistan? The world is living through dark times. Daily headlines confront us with the horror, suffering, and consequences of war and conflict in Iraq as well as in the Ivory Coast, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Haiti, Palestine and Israel, and many other places. The damage done by war to soldiers and civilians as well as to the fabric of our culture and society is incalculable. We need to understand the experiences and trauma of those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other injuries - both combat veterans and civilian victims of war. We need to hear their stories, offer support and compassion, and help to reintegrate them with their families and communities.

A film about the beauty and greatness of ordinary people under the pressure of changing regimes.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjA2ODk1NTQtNTY3My00ZDE0LThmMTMtZmIyOTc5N2Q3NTZiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR7,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906606/","userScore":5.4,"voteCount":29,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":88,"budgetUsd":230000,"diretores":[["Arto Halonen","nm0356867"]],"escritores":[["Arto Halonen","nm0356867"]],"atores":[["Josefina Aldanas","nm2461216"],["Maximiliano Artiguet","nm2462200"],["Jorge Joerge","nm2463537"],["Eduardo Mesejo Maestro","nm2460722"],["Carlos Reyes","nm2465393"]]},{"title":"Kansalainen Puupää","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620499/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"diretores":[["Peter von Bagh","nm0901911"]],"atores":[["Armand Lohikoski","nm0517833"],["Tuija Halonen","nm0356888"],["Masa Niemi","nm0631147"],["Esa Pakarinen","nm0657088"],["Anneli Sauli","nm0766674"],["Olavi Virta","nm0899441"]]},{"title":"The Vibe of Vice","description":"A behind-the-scenes featurette on the Season 1 DVD of Miami Vice detailing how the show impacted pop culture with its signature style.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23572938/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Short","Documentary"],"runtimeMin":5,"atores":[["Don Johnson","nm0000467"],["Michael Mann","nm0000520"],["Philip Michael Thomas","nm0859365"],["Jodie Lynn Tillen","nm0863293"],["Anthony Yerkovich","nm0947608"]]},{"title":"Dialogue de sourds à Caracas","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1791490/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Vanessa Mujica","nm1280530"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Deaf Dialogue","description":"A Venezuelan family is divided politically: Gabby, who is anti-Chavez lives with her mostly pro-Chavez family.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3294810/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":52,"budgetUsd":130000,"diretores":[["Vanessa Mujica","nm1280530"]],"escritores":[["Airam Cordido","nm3763824"]],"atores":[["América Bracho","nm6048596"],["Gabriela Hernandez","nm6048700"]]},{"title":"Mix Couple (Para mieszana)","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13120146/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":30000,"diretores":[["Kinga Debska","nm3070908"]],"escritores":[["Kinga Debska","nm3070908"],["Lenka Wimmerová","nm0934495"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"British Classic Motorcycles: Liam Dale's Classic Cars & Motorcycles","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNlMjVhMjQtNjZlYi00MmM5LTkwMmItNTRkYWI4YmE3ODQwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19844702/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":5000,"diretores":[["Liam Dale","nm3645961"]],"escritores":[["Sue Hosler","nm3645932"]],"atores":[["Liam Dale","nm3645961"]]},{"title":"Gordon Parks Interview","description":"Gordon Parks is interviewed by Martie Evans-Charles at his home (860 UN Plaza, Apartment 10B, NYC).
