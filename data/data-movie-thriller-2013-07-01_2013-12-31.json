Four college students venture deep into the woods as they pursue the legend of Will-O-Wisps, ghostly lights that lead unwary travelers to their doom.

Las circunstancias misteriosas que rodean la muerte de un hombre influyente acaban convirtiendo a algunos de los propios invitados en sospechosos de asesinato. El crimen que, a primera vista, parece ser resuelto, empieza a tomar un movimiento serpentino que, poco a poco, ira destapando secretos guardados y deseos ocultos, poniendo de relieve las manifestaciones del veneno interior que todos llevamos dentro.\n\nFelipe, un modesto cura y profesor de un colegio religioso, se ve implicado de forma inesperada en tales acontecimientos en los que el poder manda y el engaño impregna lo cotidiano.\n\nForzado a iniciar una investigación al margen de la ley, Felipe se hunde en un mundo oscuro donde se topara, cara a cara, con sus propios demonios que han regresado de un turbio pasado.\n\nEste largometraje actual, con reminiscencias propias del clasico cine negro, posee una estética fuertemente expresiva y una estilización visual impactante que crean una atmósfera difusa, oscura, donde las apariencias engañan y la desconfianza reina.\n\nLos espectadores se veran sumergidos en un mundo de misterio y una maraña de intriga y conflicto hasta llegar a la resolucion menos esperada.\n\n\n\n SYNOPSIS The Priest and the Poison\n\nA glamorous reception at the French Embassy in Madrid becomes the scene of a deadly crime. The mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of an influential man of the French elite transform some of the guests into murder suspects. The crime, which at first glance seems so easily solved, takes on a serpentine movement that, little by little, uncovers well-kept secrets and hidden desires, the manifestations of a personal poison that we all carry within.\n\nFelipe, an unassuming priest and teacher at a religious school for boys, finds himself caught up in a series of murders of political intrigue. Forced to begin an independent investigation outside the law, Felipe finds himself so immersed in this world of death and mistrust, that he is thrown face to face with his own dark past, from which he had tried so hard to escape.\n\nThis film resurrects the essence of classic film noir in a modern day context. With a strongly expressive and impacting aesthetic, this film creates an atmosphere of uncertainty, where appearances deceive and distrust reigns.\n\nThe audience will find themselves submerged in this world of mystery and conflict, attempting to untangle a web of intrigue, until the final and most unexpected conclusion.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU3MmFmNDEtMDI2OS00ZDNlLWExYTUtMjIwNDJmNDFjNTYwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1891790/","userScore":7.3,"voteCount":21,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":88,"budgetUsd":400000,"diretores":[["Antoni Caimari Caldés","nm4107453"]],"escritores":[["David Bombai","nm4139735"],["Innuck Roda","nm4420020"]],"atores":[["Karla Sofía Gascón","nm1035423"],["Javier Almeda","nm2832933"],["Vanessa Conde","nm3817139"],["Emma Caballero","nm3266512"],["Pilar Roman","nm4141979"],["Tony Isbert","nm0410758"],["José S.

Writing from death row, Sudo wants to confess to crimes unknown to the police. On visiting Sudo in prison, Fujii learns about a real estate broker called \"Doc\" who masterminded a string of murders that Sudo worked muscle for. Set up by Doc, Sudo seeks revenge and implores Fujii to find the evidence needed to bring in his former boss. Working off Sudo's sketchy memories, Fujii begins to piece together a grizzly tale of extortion, torture, rape, and arson. But as his desire to see Doc brought to justice nears the boiling point, he runs into resistance from his editor, who views the story as tripe, the police, who seem indifferent to the case, and his wife, who is at her wits' end dealing with his mother's increasing dementia. Based on true crime cases, \"The Devil's Path\" exposes the secret underbelly of crime in modern Japan.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWY1ZTVlMmItMmM0Ny00NzQ0LWI1ZmEtYjAwZTZhOWFjOGFlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Kyôaku","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2565752/","userScore":6.6,"voteCount":1267,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":128,"revenue":1364339,"diretores":[["Kazuya Shiraishi","nm3629099"]],"escritores":[["Kazuya Shiraishi","nm3629099"],["Izumi Takahashi","nm2107329"]],"atores":[["Takayuki Yamada","nm1303233"],["Pierre Taki","nm0847651"],["Lily Franky","nm1410940"],["Chizuru Ikewaki","nm0407514"],["Kô Itô","nm3683769"],["Hajime Tsukumo","nm1053369"]]},{"title":"Gibraltar","description":"A story centered on a man who works as an informant for the French border patrol.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTRlZmM3N2MtOGI1MC00ZTRhLThmYWEtYTEzZDY2MmExZjUyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR8,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2121304/","userScore":6.3,"voteCount":1525,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Crime","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":116,"revenue":2262343,"diretores":[["Julien Leclercq","nm2182866"]],"escritores":[["Abdel Raouf Dafri","nm2022382"],["Marc Fiévet","nm1980127"]],"atores":[["Gilles Lellouche","nm0500976"],["Tahar Rahim","nm2588665"],["Riccardo Scamarcio","nm1249052"],["Raphaëlle Agogué","nm2454487"],["Mélanie Bernier","nm0076889"],["Philippe Nahon","nm0619600"],["Aidan Devine","nm0222593"],["Vlasta Vrana","nm0903985"],["Joe Cobden","nm0167859"],["Youssef Hajdi","nm1763487"],["Jean-Philippe Puymartin","nm0701354"],["Romano Orzari","nm0651451"],["Christopher B.

As more dead bodies mount, detectives JOSEPH and MICHAEL are in a race against time to stop the serial killing.

Those namesakes are known to be some of the most saintly people that have graced the earth. As evidence continues to mount and more body bags are gathered, the detectives are convinced that the killer is basing his crimes on the belief that every generation has 36 righteous individuals who live among us, where, with all of them gone, the world would fall into chaos, corruption and eventual darkness. The hunt is on to find the last of the 36 Saints before the killer does.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzE1NzE4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk4NjI0OA@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2186663/","userScore":2.7,"voteCount":330,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Thriller"],"runtimeMin":81,"revenue":11640,"ageRating":"R","diretores":[["Eddy Duran","nm1746009"]],"escritores":[["Jeffrey De Serrano","nm1490232"],["Joey Dedio","nm0214114"]],"atores":[["Franky G","nm1065281"],["Jeffrey De Serrano","nm1490232"],["Donna McKechnie","nm0571124"],["Jamie Tirelli","nm0864222"],["Britne Oldford","nm4162863"],["Tyrone Marshall Brown","nm3138827"],["Matthew Daddario","nm4568989"],["Aja Naomi King","nm3813115"],["Chris Riggi","nm2861180"],["Alesandra Assante","nm1348306"],["Allan Louis","nm0521854"],["Laverne Cox","nm1209545"],["Raul Casso","nm4091343"],["Mihaela Kolich","nm2619434"],["Joey Dedio","nm0214114"],["Maya Days","nm1424660"],["Dominic Colón","nm1501093"],["Frances Lozada","nm1293330"]]},{"title":"Island","description":"Set during a nuclear disaster, a group of young people are trapped in a school.

Then things take a turn for the worst when merciless gunmen come hunting for Zee and his best buddy/cohort, Redd (Christopher Collard). Turns out, the two wanted men made a huge blunder 'at work'. Or did they? However, many lives were brutally expended on their watch and now their ruthless boss, Danny Stunner Sr. aka Stone (Troy Coe) wants payback. So, as bullets fly and bodies fall, Lori finds herself caught smack in the bull's-eye of a bloody vendetta. In an ironic twist of fate the man who rescued her becomes the harbinger her demise - albeit inadvertently. She must decide whether to attempt to save herself or to join her two fugitive friends to kill - or be killed - as they adamantly fight their way home.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4NWM1MjMtOGJiOC00NDBiLTg2YzAtYWZlN2Y3ZjE0YzNlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1732577/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Action","Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":73,"diretores":[["Gordon Divine Asaah","nm3395785"]],"escritores":[["Gordon Divine Asaah","nm3395785"]],"atores":[["Christopher Collard","nm1705240"],["Dominique Rochelle","nm2676010"],["Amanda Harris","nm4101481"],["Troy Coe","nm2669208"],["Zas Seda","nm2996847"],["Michael Barrett","nm4102302"],["Andrew Block","nm4102622"],["Jamie Teer","nm2378853"],["Ashley Patterson","nm4102267"],["Brandon Dion","nm4097473"],["James A.E.

The story follows the background of a political campaign of a presidential candidate. There are two months remaining to the elections. Adam Lambert, a successful and influential owner of an advertising agency, gets a job - to create a political campaign for a peculiar candidate - an indistinctive small-town entrepreneur. The goal is simply to stir the political waters and strip the opposite party of a few votes. Lambert is used to manipulating people without a blink of an eye and always gets what he wants. However, during a dinner party he is provoked into a bet against his rival - Ivan Muller, who works for the heaviest favorite of the elections. The stake is approximately 7 million euros. Lambert bets all his fortune on a single horse, the unknown candidate. He swears he will transform this loser into a president, and that he will accomplish that not later than in the first round of the elections. The movie Candidate depicts what goes on in the political scene, or what can come to pass very easily. It is a cynical analysis of the society which lets itself be manipulated by the rich and the powerful. Those who pull the strings create a world where the line between truth and illusion or good and evil disappears.

As time and space begin to split, the relations between the two couples in the film turn complicated, and all ends in the maze existing in the parallel universe. The theme of the film centers on Arthur Schopenhauer's idea -- \"The world is my will\", and the structure form bases on the multiverse theory. The splitting of science and culture has been a worldwide issue ever since the 1960s when C.P. Snow delivered his famous speech on The Two Cultures. What will be revealed when we examine the traditional humanistic thoughts with advanced science and technology? Quantum Theory and Chaos Theory have put an end to our traditional cognition and forced us to rediscover the universe and ourselves. The core ideas of modern science like nonlinearity, indeterminacy, probability theory, etc, are well combined with the structure of the film as well as the destinies of the characters. The world and life presented in Parallel Maze is like the superposition of quantum, forming a mass of chaos. The film conveys the director's understanding and expectation on films in the 21 Century.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MTAwNDg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkyMTE3NzE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Yì cì yuan mí gong","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3299316/","userScore":4.3,"voteCount":15,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Adventure","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":100,"diretores":[["Hua Ya","nm6053162"]],"escritores":[["Hua Ya","nm6053162"]],"atores":[["Xiang Bin","nm2765666"],["YaShu Zhan","nm6316708"],["Run Zhang","nm6316709"],["Qiyu Yang","nm3002227"],["Jinglong Li","nm6316710"]]},{"title":"Colorless Green","description":"After a domestic terrorist attack, a local high school computer hacker discovers a revolutionary new program that tracks down those responsible.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDdhMmY2ZTYtMTQ5OS00YTcyLTg0MWYtOTU1MjY2MTNlZjFkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,4,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3266366/","userScore":6.1,"voteCount":50,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":82,"diretores":[["Ryan Eslinger","nm1435316"]],"escritores":[["Ryan Eslinger","nm1435316"]],"atores":[["Kenneth Applegate","nm4045288"],["Joey Barbour","nm11854772"],["Cosette Barth","nm6057360"],["Daniel Beecher","nm0066318"],["Sage Brandon","nm6034804"],["Shelly Brandon","nm5251001"],["Nate Clark","nm11854773"],["Noah Cohen","nm5726469"],["Kelsi Cullimore","nm1570097"],["Demetrius Daniels","nm11854775"],["Tony Davis","nm5492792"],["Jesse Eskelson","nm11854776"],["Terrell Eskelson","nm6034813"],["William Ferrer","nm3688129"],["Chantel Flanders","nm3154969"],["Justin Goodey","nm6034805"],["Austin R.

He's got a 9-to-5 job, follows quite a predictable routine both at work and in his personal life, and appears to be satisfied with the way things are. Yet, behind the surface, there's another side to him. He has a history of psychiatric problems and is now medicated - but don't picture a zombie; he's just your average urban man on your average meds. Plus there's something that's driving him insane: he suffers from an acute case of insomnia. Gradually, his sleeping disorder begins to hinder his work performance; he blames the lame condition of his pillows for his insomnia. So instead of going to see a shrink (again), he decides to buy a NASA-designed intelligent pillow. Believe it or not, he actually wakes up feeling unstressed and well rested. In no time, he's sleeping like a baby. That is, until he begins to have strongly disturbing nightmares. Soon enough, he starts losing touch with reality and feeling like he's someone else. From here on, it all goes into a spiral of unavoidable madness. Or is there any reality to some of the things he's experiencing?
