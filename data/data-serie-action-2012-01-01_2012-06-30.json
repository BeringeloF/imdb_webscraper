Around two decades later, Margaret and Joseph's son Marco (Richard Gomez) develops feelings for Emily Cardenas (Dawn Zulueta), a daughter of a worker in their plantation. However, numerous circumstances and Margaret's haughtiness towards Emily prompts Marco to marry rich banker Jane Bonifacio (Rita Avila) much to Emily's detriment.

Distraught, Bea's mother Tina leaves the venue of the party in tears and unfortunately meets an accident when an explosion takes place in the building, which also puts at risk Sharon and Julia. While Tina agonizes in pain, Sharon sees this as an opportunity to replace the former in Rico's life leading her to kill Tina. As Bea weeps for her mother's demise, she puts the blame on her father, who is then being pressured by Sharon to marry her or else she and her daughter will leave thecountry for good. Rico, torn between Bea's disapproval and the possibility of building a new family with Sharon, eventually gives in to Sharon's demands. As Sharon assumes the role of Rico's new wife, her true colors further surface as she mistreats Bea behind Rico's back. Feeling helpless and alone more than ever, Bea runs away from home and travels to her grandmother's province. However, as Bea begins to find comfort in the arms of her Lola Lourdes , she discovers that her father is gravely ill and that Sharon has started to take over the company. More than that, she uncovers more of her stepmother's evil deeds, including the real reason why her mother died, prompting her to return home and reunite with her father.

Among twelve exciting episodes (plus one \"Special Christmas\"), we will know the story of a veteran cop, the rude and alcoholic Jack Hunter, and his companion, the young and handsome Lenny Lafiamma, buddies in arms in a criminal fictional Michigan D.C. They are consecrated law agents of The Michigan Patrol Police, a Corp that doesn't exist. And this Michigan city is plenty of dangerous villains, more than ever, in every street, in each corner. Jack Hunter lost his family years ago, so he drinks a lot; and Lenny Lafiamma is not be able to be a wife; he is the coolest, but the saddest too. Meanwhile, the evil Mendoza and his rapists, move the strings and rule the criminal suburbs. Mendoza is the Jack Hunter's worst nemesis, since he killed the young Timmy (Jack's eleven years old son) in the past. Now, he's leave the Federal Prison of Michigan, and he is furious, ready to execute the perfect revenge against Jack, killing his partner, stealing him everything and becoming the Evil Master King of Michigan.
