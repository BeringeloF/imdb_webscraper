Vincent is the politician, the man who always has a plan to help keep the peace, find common ground, bind blood and commerce, and grow the family into a billion-dollar empire. Jack is the muscle, the hot head; ruthless and uncompromising, he lives in the moment and executes his actions based on how he feels. Unfortunately for these two men, these two philosophies don't always work together. Jack enforces his code of duty and honor with a brutal finality that sometimes destroys Vincent's creative scheming. Jack also finds himself unexpectedly protecting the underdogs in his neighborhood, which sometimes creates more trouble for him than it's worth. Vincent makes deals with rival families knowing that money is the glue that keeps the peace, avoids problems with law enforcement, and builds a future. But having to turn the other cheek drives Jack mad when it sells out his personal integrity, and often he can't do it. Somehow the cousins get through each day, keep their enemies guessing, and keep business booming. \"Real Gangsters\" is an adrenaline rush. A constant rollercoaster ride of classic crime, class acts, and the thrill that comes from living life on the edge, one day at a time, when at any moment you could need to put your life on the line to serve and protect the family.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNjQ3NTc2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc0MjM4OQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2865074/","userScore":7.1,"voteCount":7066,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Crime","Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":88,"ageRating":"Unrated","diretores":[["Frank D'Angelo","nm0195264"]],"escritores":[["Frank D'Angelo","nm0195264"],["Philip Morton","nm0608068"]],"atores":[["Paul Amato","nm0024179"],["Steven Bauer","nm0000874"],["Jason Blicker","nm0088379"],["Frank A.

His life has been marked with various twists and turns that has always left a common man in oblivion of sorts. His crimes have been marked as acts of bloody thirst for power and money by the forces that have kept a track on him during his tenure as a brigand. This movie is made with a pure journalistic perspective. An in depth study of his life and activities which includes the final moments has been done over the past eleven years. Two hundred and fifty and odd first hand people connected to his life have been interviewed. The cinema is shot on real and authentic locations connected to the events. Also keeping the cinematic value intact, we have not left any stone untouched when it comes to the realistic genre of cinema with respect to this story. The cinema covers everything from the brigand's birth to death and all the pivotal events connected to his story. One should look out for the thrilling moments in the climax of the movie, captured with great rustic detail.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM5MzkxNDctODVkYy00NDYzLWE3YjQtYjg2NjgyMzFkMjk2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,4,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2938702/","userScore":7,"voteCount":180,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Biography","Crime","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":171,"diretores":[["A.M.R.

After several internal political problems, a coup has left the country under military control. Quito is the last frontier, the city has been completely fenced, enclosed and sheltered. The film starts from this point and focuses on two locations only. One, the palace where the General Ponce, a cynical and cunning man who runs the party, and is in charge of the city. The second, the headquarters of a group of young revolutionaries led by Marcos and Santiago, two guys with completely different visions. Marcosis hungry for power and strength. The other, his buddy Santiago, a man that has lost all hope for a better tomorrow. The film, without any political agenda, focuses on the hours before the revolutionaries make their last attack with the goal of overthrowing the tyranny that surrounds the city. These two places and characters are woven together to tell a story that is directly based on dialog rather than in action, in which the attitude of each one of them is analyzed, between ambition, power, humility and faith of those who expect a better future. The conclusion is that this is perhaps not more than another case of a social upheaval in Latin America, where there is really no solution in a region characterized by high ungovernability and the ingenuity of his own people.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ4NTkzNzQ5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzkxNjUwMTE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527560/","userScore":5.1,"voteCount":69,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":90,"budgetUsd":300000,"ageRating":"TV-14","diretores":[["César Izurieta","nm4980762"],["Juan Fernando Moscoso","nm5381728"]],"escritores":[["Lorena Caicedo","nm5370130"],["César Izurieta","nm4980762"],["Juan Fernando Moscoso","nm5381728"]],"atores":[["Silvio Villagómez","nm5411135"],["Jose Luís Vergara","nm5411098"],["Enrique Carvajal","nm5409142"],["Elvira Durango","nm5408257"],["Jorge Ulloa","nm4501710"],["Orlando Herrera","nm3621147"]]},{"title":"Feeding Mr. Baldwin","description":"A house sitter bites off more than he can chew when a dead body mysteriously shows up at the estate he's watching.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ0MjJlMGUtZTYwOS00NjQyLWE1MDItYjIyNDAyMDliMjE4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,6,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2201772/","userScore":5.5,"voteCount":142,"releaseYear":2013,"genres":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":94,"budgetUsd":200000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Will Prescott","nm2048749"]],"escritores":[["Will Prescott","nm2048749"]],"atores":[["Dalton Leeb","nm2061147"],["Anil Margsahayam","nm1905449"],["Christopher B.

Concord negotiates to allow access to Nirvana, where all worldly troubles disappear. In exchange, those who accept the deal must give him all of their possessions and stay in a house for one week. In the house are four caretakers who test each participant to see if they qualify for Nirvana or if they end up in the graveyard behind the house. The series explores and questions faith, morality, tolerance, and common sense; these are the tests of the caretakers. At the end of each week, Concord returns to the house to evaluate the test results of the participants to decide the fate of each guest and of the caretakers. Set in small town America, at the end of a charming little street. This house has stood here long before anyone can remember, or anyone can forget. It has it's own personality and once inside you truly understand what that means. Whole floors will appear and vanish, walls will move, and artifacts will be uncovered, all so the house can show you your purpose for being there. Not even the caretakers can truly understand or control the will of the house. It is truly the key to all the answers that the caretakers and guests are looking for. In season one, the house, which we find out, is possessed with the spirit of Concord's mother and Concord are waging a war of power to control the house. Caught in the middle are the guests as well as the caretakers. \"Mother\" and Concord alike will use these people as pawns to gain the upper hand. All this, as the caretakers try and conduct their \"business as usual\". Not to mention a graveyard full of spirits trying to get out.
