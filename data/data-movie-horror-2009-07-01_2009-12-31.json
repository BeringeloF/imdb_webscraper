As his father, Jack Sr.(played Tony-award winning Joe Mantegna), lays dying, he asks his only son to preserve the family estate, and to never tear it down. The pact is made, but within a year, the cocky young music producer, demolishes the estate and builds his \"party palace\". On the night of Jack's house warming party, friends and family party into the early morning, unaware of the \"monstrous spirit\" who returns to murder them one-by-one, until only his grandson is left to destroy. GRANDPA JACK takes human form and systematically executes the \"guests\". Having to do battle with the demon, Jack's own memories emerge that have been haunting him for years in nightmares. On one fateful night 23 years ago, three year old Jack Jr. witnessed the gruesome murder of his own mother, Hannah, at the hands of his own grandfather. Having buried the event inside his head, and told over and over that his mother had committed suicide, Jack's life was one of pain and confusion. But now, after breaking a sacred deathbed oath, Jack's own demons re-surface; and he must do battle with the one demon who all but destroyed his life: his own grandfather. In the action-filled climax, Jack Jr. must take on the \"spirit\" himself to rid the world and himself of this evil. But he finds he can't fight the old bastard alone... and gets help from a shocking source: HIS MOTHER. The \"spirit\" of Hannah Filice returns to take on the man who brutally killed her, and thus, fights to save the life of the little boy, now a grown man, who is about to die at the hands of the same monster who destroyed her some 20 years ago. The screenplay has received great \"buzz\" in Hollywood for its fresh take on an established genre; in addition, for its well-rounded characters and yes, wry humor. But THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT is also a terrifying story of violence, family secrets and lies; and creates a world where life and death seem to weld together, where the \"afterlife\" may not be so \"after\", afterall.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MzQ5OTEzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE0ODA0Mg@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,7,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1122765/","userScore":3.1,"voteCount":137,"releaseYear":2009,"genres":["Horror"],"runtimeMin":88,"budgetUsd":1500000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Bruce Reisman","nm0718451"]],"escritores":[["Kris Black","nm2411088"],["Bruce Reisman","nm0718451"]],"atores":[["Kris Black","nm2411088"],["Joe Mantegna","nm0001505"],["Gail O'Grady","nm0641097"],["Suzanne Happ","nm0361611"],["Monica Allgeier","nm1179717"],["Michael Guarnera","nm1396591"],["Jessica Anderson","nm2013198"],["Chantelle Barry","nm0057951"],["Justin Shilton","nm0793526"],["Arielle Brachfeld","nm2290733"],["Peter Onorati","nm0648846"],["Ashlee Curtis","nm3304830"],["Elana Fargquarson","nm2804371"],["Steve Filice","nm1289167"],["Micaela Gruber","nm2796929"],["Carissa Kosta","nm1189960"],["Gene Galassini","nm1232443"],["Shar Jackson","nm0005046"]]},{"title":"Kerala Cafe","description":"A series of related and unrelated tales together linking them in subtle ways and discuss different shades of life.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmExNzRkOTctMmM1Zi00OTdmLWFlMTEtMzM3ZTBjODliMjE1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1539997/","userScore":7.4,"voteCount":1195,"releaseYear":2009,"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Family","Horror"],"runtimeMin":140,"diretores":[["Uday Ananthan","nm2776729"],["Lal Jose","nm0430485"],["Shaji Kailas","nm0435050"]],"escritores":[["Deedi Damodaran","nm3844906"],["Rajesh Jayaraman","nm1847868"],["Lal Jose","nm0430485"]],"atores":[["Sathyan Anthikad","nm0030791"],["Augustine","nm0041919"],["M.A. Baby","nm4194040"],["Nandan Chalissery","nm4194078"],["Santha Devi","nm1526450"],["Dileep","nm0226770"],["Fahadh Faasil","nm1335704"],["Suresh Gopi","nm0329730"],["Jayakumar","nm3264948"],["Jayasurya","nm1334389"],["Jyothirmayi","nm1411659"],["Sasi Kalinga","nm4051131"],["Rima Kallingal","nm3634501"],["Kalpana","nm1427780"],["Molly Kannamaly","nm5663832"],["Suresh Krishna","nm1668529"],["Salim Kumar","nm1368581"],["Kani Kusruti","nm4225184"]]},{"title":"Phantom Racer","description":"A race car driver returns from the grave to seek vengeance on his enemies","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM0NzE2NzgyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc3MzgxMw@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR46,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320354/","userScore":4,"voteCount":590,"releaseYear":2009,"genres":["Action","Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":87,"ageRating":"TV-14","diretores":[["Terry Ingram","nm0409036"]],"escritores":[["Keith Shaw","nm1433581"],["Jason Bourque","nm1028302"]],"atores":[["Nicole Eggert","nm0001176"],["Greg Evigan","nm0263760"],["Brenna O'Brien","nm1378650"],["Winston Rekert","nm0718759"],["Chad Willett","nm0929814"],["Luciana Carro","nm1382781"],["Adam Battrick","nm1568911"],["Colin Lawrence","nm0492687"],["Robert Parent","nm0661303"],["Andrew Francis","nm0290075"],["Jackson Berlin","nm3385467"],["Brett Dier","nm2322192"],["Sean Owen Roberts","nm1016503"],["Kwesi Ameyaw","nm0024780"],["Byron Brisco","nm0109786"],["Jason Griffith","nm0341531"],["Barry Haggis","nm3268821"],["Sarah Smyth","nm1222371"]]},{"title":"Sweatshop","description":"A group of friends break into an abandoned factory in order to throw a impromptu party;

Four friends are out having a typical evening of unwinding at the area's social hub, the roller-rink, a place filled with magic moments and meaningful memories. Bobby, a rebel wrapped in leather and blue jeans, the very definition of cool. Rosie, she's Bobby's girl, tough as nails but sweet as cotton candy. Jimmy, a closet bookworm just trying to fit in and the new guy in town. And Peggy Sue, cuter than a pail full of kittens, she's along for the ride and in over her head. Performing live at the roller-rink is a yet unknown musical marvel, one of the first real rock 'n rollers, Buddy himself. Buddy is in trouble, he's been on a losing streak and owes a bundle he doesn't have to the local hard-nosed book-maker... and it's time to pay or pray. On the knife's edge of town the dead have begun to rise, re-animated and un-living, a terrible side-effect of dangerous experimentation. The music and squeals of joy coming from inside the roller-rink draws them near with a powerful hunger. Soon they'll be inside and then there's no stopping them. Soon all hell will break loose in an unimaginable cornucopia of gore, violent grotesqueries the likes of which no one has imagined. Soon they'll have killed every last man, woman and child in this once quaint, quiet little town. Soon, a man and his brand new '55 Fender Stratocaster Sunburst will make a stand... Can Buddy and his rag-tag team of survivors quell the Zombie onslaught? Will Buddy live to see his first #1 record?

His two sons, Jonathan and Luke emerge from this twisted life corrupted with evil to govern the Black Foundation. The Black Foundation is a movement in the United States, which suggests that the Government apologize to slave descendants for their hardships, and bestow on them reparations, whether it be in the form of money, land, or other goods. In the year 2045, the Black Foundation is a new movement to secure reparations for African Americans. They demand a clear apology for the slavery from the former slave-trading countries and the United States of America. By any means necessary.. \"..Or Holy Hell will break loose..\" It isn't late before Luke, the oldest son, discovers the power and guidance of Christ and not only tries to save himself but his brother and father as well. We all know Christ will prevail, but will it be too late for the Maxwell Family??","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3Njc4MDkyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgxMTQyMg@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR6,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323927/","userScore":5.8,"voteCount":33,"releaseYear":2009,"genres":["Horror"],"runtimeMin":117,"budgetUsd":30000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Lamont A.

Dead Dog (Benoit Decaillon) is shackled by the insanely domineering Vampire Max (Edouard Audouin). Dead Dog gets caught up in a brutal war of Vampires as he is trained to slaughter innocent humans to satisfy the blood thirsty Prince of Vampires. After 30 years of grueling service, Dead Dog longs to free himself from this brutal madness of his unending life where he never ages. When he meets the beautiful Pussy Cat, a mysterious girl - Dead Dog at last finds meaning to his existence and struggles to set himself free. Sodium Babies is a stunning visual smorgasbord of imagery - a cross between the graphic novel style of Sin City and True Blood spiced with the pathology of Fight Club.

VILLEMOLLE 81 will make your day with its man hunt and chase scenes, handmade splatter, mutilation, and nuclear explosion scenes. Simultaneously, Vincent Paronnaud's newest film is a reflection on the position of the zombie in the contemporary French society.

All is not as it seems on the country's most watched family game-show... Reality television has taken things to the extreme and given the public, The Knackery, a show where six contestants fight for the grand prize of 'one million pounds'. To liven things up, the producers of the show release a horde of genetically modified zombies which puts a little bit more pressure on the fighters, in this Big Brother style beat-em-up. As an undercover reporter tries to scoop the story he's been waiting for, he soon comes across a kid who has entered the arena unaware of the consequences. Seeing this as another excuse for higher ratings, the shows producers announce their new contestant as they witness the fighting skills of the youngster against others - but as the fighters get killed off, things take a turn for the worse leaving the reporter and kid to team up against some very tough opponents... human and not-so-human.
