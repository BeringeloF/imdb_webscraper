This documentary recounts the amazing legacy of the 1980s WWF through archival footage, interviews, and classic matches with 15 of its most legendary superstars, including Junkyard Dog, Sgt.

The film features stories of child laborers around the world, told in their own words. Children are shown working in dumps, quarries, brick kilns. One boy has been pressed into forced labor on a fishing platform in the Sea of Sumatra, a fifteen-year-old runaway describes being forced into prostitution on the streets of Mexico City, while a nine-year-old girl picks coffee in Kenya to help her family survive. The film places these children's stories in the broader context of the worldwide struggle against child labor. Stolen Childhoods provides an understanding of the causes of child labor, what it costs the global community, how it contributes to global insecurity and what it will take to eliminate it. The film shows best practice programs that remove children from work and put them in school, so that they have a chance to develop as children and also have a chance of making a reasonable living when they grow up. Stolen Childhoods challenges the viewer to help break the cycle of poverty for the 246 million children laboring at the bottom of the global economy.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDZhMzRmOTAtMjZmYy00ZTdjLTgzZTgtNzkzMTkyNjRjMWQyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR23,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464216/","userScore":7.3,"voteCount":35,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":85,"revenue":2996,"diretores":[["Len Morris","nm0606727"],["U.

People have gone to great lengths to explain away Lance Armstrong's greatness as an athlete. Some look for explanations in his physiology. Some say his will is just stronger than most. Others say he's ruthlessly demanded no less than excellence from his teammates. The truth lies somewhere in a combination of these factors, and few aspects of his story are less than fascinating. He leaves his career at the top of his game, with an unprecedented six Tour de France wins under his bike. But what's truly amazing is he's done this after being issued a near death sentence. In 1998 he was diagnosed with stage 3 testicular cancer that had metastasized in his lungs and brain. True to form, he battled the disease like a champion, and like most other mountains that have slowed Lance's forward motion, he eventually conquered it. But this is by no means a mountain he's left behind. Cancer was something that galvanized his resolve, both on and off the bike and contributed to his evolution as an athlete and as a man. After beating cancer, he began to take a serious look at training and became committed to improving his physiology. He also dedicated himself to chasing down even the slightest improvements in technology, living by the philosophy of \"every second counts.\" From the communication system used by the team, the Nike clothing he wears, to the Trek bicycles he rides, no detail that would improve his chances on the bike is left untested. Lance has also embraced science in what may be the most important way possible. He's dedicated himself to conquering the disease that nearly destroyed him by raising research dollars through the Lance Armstrong Foundation. His athleticism and fighting spirit have become an inspiration to not only people battling cancer, but to anyone who appreciates a shining example of the indomitability of the human spirit. And as he rides into history to try and achieve his 7th Tour de France win, the world cheers him on. Because Lance Armstrong crosses the starting line a winner.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGYyZTIzNWEtZWU5MS00MTlhLTljNzktNmFiMDJmNWY3YmY3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466975/","userScore":6.5,"voteCount":35,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Biography","Sport"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Martin Canellakis","nm1770731"]],"escritores":[["Martin Canellakis","nm1770731"]],"atores":[["Lance Armstrong","nm0035790"]]},{"title":"The Gay Marriage Thing","description":"Lorre and Gayle were heartbroken when they learned their two great-aunts - sisters who'd lived together their entire 80+ years - were on the verge of losing their 1850's home because it was too big a burden to care for anymore. \"Having to leave your home just because you're older?\" Lorre asks. \"After living there 60 years?\" Gayle adds. \"Unfair,\" they agree. So they did something about it. Lorre and Gayle broke their apartment rental lease and moved in with a very grateful Gertrude and Germaine, to be financial, emotional and physical caregivers for their elderly aunts. \"We were the Golden Girls for a while there, and we still call ourselves that, even though we lost Auntie Gert last year,\" Lorre adds. \"But Auntie Germaine is still feisty and we do for her because that's what we've both been taught. You take care of family.\" With that, the first few moments of THE GAY MARRIAGE THING paint a picture of what it means to be a family. Gayle and Lorre, thirtysomething college sweethearts who marked their 15th anniversary a year after the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled a ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, form the heart of this documentary scrapbook. From the protests outside the Massachusetts State House, to the churches of the Reverends Rich Wiesenbach and Carlton Smith, to the historic chambers echoing State Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein's perspective, and to how all of these voices swirl in the air around Gayle and Lorre as they approach May 17, 2004, the first date same-sex couples could file for marriage licenses in Massachusetts. While eavesdropping on the emotional and spiritual toll this issue has taken upon all parties, the story carries forth to the everyday angst and anticipation of Lorre and Gayle's own wedding. THE GAY MARRIAGE THING is not some historical commentary on gay rights in the United States. It is instead a small story with big implications. By focusing on one suburban couple and the multitude of events that directly affect that couple's otherwise average life, THE GAY MARRIAGE THING strives to show a different side of this issue than documentaries or television newscasts have thus far. This tale is cinematic in its storytelling, rather than journalistic in its reporting. There are plenty of other worthy documentaries where \"experts\" abound.

It investigates the role of Warren Jeffs, Head \"Prophet\" of the FLDS, and offers a searing indictment of his treatment of fellow cult members. It also addresses the lack of outrage from the mainstream Mormon church as well as the government's collective failure to take care of the problems that are plaguing many polygamists caught in this web of greed and deceit.

This unique form of artistic and historical expression has survived ocean voyages of thousands of miles, cyclones, volcanic eruptions, and internecine wars. But the greatest threat to their dance traditions came from European and American colonizers who disapproved of these \"pagan\" and \"primitive practices\" and attempted to destroy them. They almost succeeded. Until 1972, it appeared that this dance tradition would be wiped out entirely. But that year, the Conference of the Pacific Community decided \"to combat the erosion of traditional customary practices\" by organizing the first Festival of Pacific Arts. There have now been a total of eight Pacific Arts Festivals. Each of these events have built a steadily larger constituency for this art form. However, none of them, have been thoroughly documented on film so that these diverse cultures can be seen, understood, remembered, appreciated, and admired by the islanders themselves and by audiences throughout the world. The ninth Pacific Arts Festival was held in Palau in July of 2004. On that occasion, International Cultural Programming , in partnership with Pacific Islanders in Communication, the Executive Committee of the Palau Festival Community, PBS and UNESCO, made the first thorough documentation of this event on high-definition video for national and international broadcast and for historic archive. The objective is to further the Pacific Community's purpose of reviving, perpetuating and promoting this cultural experience by bringing it to an audience of millions of viewers in the United States, Europe and the Pacific Islands -- and by creating a permanent archive that will be accessible to any interested party free of charge. The Pacific Islands are largely unknown to most of the world. The purpose of this film is to enhance our understanding of their cultural identity, their civic life and their artistic achievement.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMjM0MTIzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ0MDA2MDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR3,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444614/","userScore":8.9,"voteCount":20,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"budgetUsd":500000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Catherine Tatge","nm0851232"]],"escritores":[["Leslie Clark","nm3160939"]],"atores":[["Keisha Castle-Hughes","nm1095720"],["Andrew Scott","nm7537167"]]},{"title":"What Hollywood Taught Us About Sex","description":"The lessons we've learned about sex from movies and television.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450344/","userScore":7.5,"voteCount":15,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"budgetUsd":500000,"ageRating":"TV-14","diretores":[["Dan Riley","nm1111811"]],"escritores":[["Jeff Corriveau","nm1445236"]],"atores":[["Victor Alfieri","nm0019133"],["Regan Burns","nm0122846"],["Liz Feldman","nm0271078"],["Richie Keen","nm0007193"],["Joshua Kopel","nm1957307"],["Ron Lester","nm0504516"],["Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg","nm0000189"],["Gabrielle Tuite","nm0876266"]]},{"title":"Die Hitlers - Eine Familiengeschichte","description":"The family history of the Hitlerites as the background for a fatal period in history.

Boyishly charming and with many stories to tell, Johnny takes us on a trip through his life. He's a true wanderer, a man without a home base, whose only plan is to spend his savings on a trip to Cambodia to write his long-gestating novel.

The Summer Season in Blackpool proved to be just as dramatic as the Spring Tour and this film managed to capture many great and often touching moments.

Life comes to us \"As Is\". Still, we are all immersed in a culture where the primary, if not primordial, message is: \"more, more, more.\" Earn more, spend more, consume more and possess more of everything - the implicit promise is that happiness and fulfillment will be yours if only you have more. \"As Is\" explores that fundamental premise through the stories of nine divergent people from the USA and abroad who must re-examine the value of their lives as they encounter economic simplicity. Earning less and spending less runs contrary to everything they've been taught. All were once distinctively upwardly mobile. While \"As Is\" presents four gritty real accounts of the fallout of unemployment, displacement and deprivation, it is saved from utter bleakness by the earthy and hope-infused accounts of five other people who embraced voluntary economic simplicity for reasons ranging from the spiritual and environmental to personal development and artistic growth. Former Disney artists, entertainers, physicians, monastic nuns, educators all dispossessed and challenging the axiomatic \"more, more, more\" with the idea that a well lived life has less to do with more and more to do with better.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDIyODM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDYzMTA2MDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR87,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0847155/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":70,"budgetUsd":10000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Maryanne Galvin","nm1458614"]],"escritores":[["Maryanne Galvin","nm1458614"]],"atores":[["Dominic A'Vant","nm2117732"],["Sr. Monica Burt","nm2366154"],["Merry Citoli","nm2363805"],["Bob Corbett","nm2366260"],["Joyce Johnson","nm2361567"],["Johanna Kaputanffy","nm2364657"],["Marie Keep","nm2365783"],["Veronic Paje-Rafael","nm2368000"],["Brian Quint","nm1954460"],["Kathy Schoeppner","nm2121578"]]},{"title":"Bania","description":"\"Bania\" is an exploration of Russian society through its bath-houses in the city, the countryside, in a monastery, a factory or a prison.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ5Y2U0YzAtY2EzZS00OGMyLWEwM2YtNDNkMGI0YjQxY2ZiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR104,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762074/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":65,"diretores":[["David Teboul","nm1519362"]],"escritores":[["David Teboul","nm1519362"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Europa: The Faecal Location","description":"Asst.

Indeed, businessmen, and those simply passing through the city, made a point to patronize this five-story complex sandwiched in the heart of industria1 Portland. Sadly, as the century gave way to the development of high-rise and commercial lodging, the Plaza began a downward spiral into the shadow of its towering competition. Eric Lahey took up residence at The Century Plaza Hotel to document this forgotten fragment of society. Through Rico the cat, the only enduring resident of the hotel, the untold stories of this nebulous culture slowly unfold as he wanders his urban enclave. For some, The Century Plaza is a meeting place, a safe haven for the exchange or abuse of illicit drugs; for others it signifies a luxurious break from the streets and a heated room and bed. Quality is of little importance. Although the conditions may seem appalling to the general population, the patrons are concerned with more important matters than their standard of living. The plaza affords refuge and survival. Stories unravel by those gripped with mental illness, drug addiction, and disease. Through spontaneous conversations, their captivating tales and diverse personalities will draw your attention, and engross you in their private world. Their contentment with simple pleasures is remarkably humbling.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyNzM2MjQ3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTUzMzk0ODE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466533/","userScore":8.2,"voteCount":67,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":79,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Eric Lahey","nm1864618"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Sin City: The Premiere","description":"Interviews with the cast, director and other red carpet arrivals at the London premiere of Sin City (2005).","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2ZlOGIyNDctZjJiNy00MzE1LTk5ZjYtNTZiMmIwMjU0MmM2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,1,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465604/","userScore":6.7,"voteCount":150,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":30,"atores":[["Jenni Falconer","nm0266009"],["Jessica Alba","nm0004695"],["Devon Aoki","nm1226817"],["Elizabeth Avellan","nm0042882"],["Alexis Bledel","nm0088127"],["Rosario Dawson","nm0206257"],["Benicio Del Toro","nm0001125"],["Michael Clarke Duncan","nm0003817"],["Madonna","nm0000187"],["Michael Madsen","nm0000514"],["Frank Miller","nm0588340"],["Brittany Murphy","nm0005261"],["The Noise Next Door","nm1848594"],["Clive Owen","nm0654110"],["Guy Ritchie","nm0005363"],["Robert Rodriguez","nm0001675"],["Mickey Rourke","nm0000620"],["Quentin Tarantino","nm0000233"]]},{"title":"La isla donde duerme la edad de oro","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E2OGU3YzUtMmNlZS00NzQxLTg2NGYtMTk5ZWY1MDdmMjZjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993011/","userScore":8.6,"voteCount":9,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":90,"diretores":[["Isabelle Dierckx","nm2604082"]],"escritores":[["Isabelle Dierckx","nm2604082"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Penis Dementia: The Search for the Perfect Penis","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479737/","userScore":5.4,"voteCount":79,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":52,"diretores":[["Michael McNamara","nm0573710"]],"escritores":[["Michael McNamara","nm0573710"]],"atores":[["Ron Jeremy","nm0000465"],["Daniel Lamarche","nm6355571"]]},{"title":"Anima, l'esprit des marionnettes","description":"Which child is not fascinated by a puppet show?

Together and separately, the congregation and Pastor Smith examine their losses and their gains when Susie left the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in order to be with her partner and to continue to serve as a minister In the second segment, \"A Mother's Son,\" The Calhoun family explores the shock, the grief and the now strengthened families ties between them that were deeply tested when their son first came out. Among the challenges, the Calhouns were forced to chose between their congregation and their son. The third segment records the powerful reunion between two women who had parted under tragic circumstances years earlier. Now both mature women, at the time of their first encounter Joanna Adams was a young minister and Kathryn Cartledge was a parishioner filled with self-loathing about her core identity. Decades later they explore together what went wrong in the first encounter, telling a story that is both heart wrenching and healing. The final segment, \"Open Door,\" examines the wellbeing of a welcoming Presbyterian congregation and their members in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In interviews and in worship, members and leaders of the congregation express their insights and attitudes toward being a welcoming place for gay and lesbian Christians. In-between each segment, deeply respected theologians Homer Ashby (McCormick), Walter Brueggemann (Columbia) Beverly Roberts Gaventa (Princeton), and Shirley Guthrie Jr. (Columbia) connect the stories to scripture and faith.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5Mzc3NjgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg5MjgzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,4,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0860553/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":57,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["David Sampliner","nm1503443"]],"atores":[["Joanna Adams","nm2386481"],["Homer Ashby","nm2383271"],["Walter Brueggemann","nm2388094"],["Anita Calhoun","nm2386165"],["Jason Calhoun","nm2387059"],["Kathryn Cartledge","nm2383313"],["Beverly Roberts Gaventa","nm2384661"],["Shirley Guthrie Jr.","nm2383364"],["Tim Hart-Andersen","nm2386704"],["Susie B.

Some were clowns, fairy godmothers, or spacemen but Boston had a real cowboy named Rex Trailer. He is the subject of this first feature-length film by Massachusetts native Michael Bavaro. Trailer's interactive Western-themed show 'Boomtown' was a weekend staple for the 4 million children who watched on WBZ-TV in Boston and which reached into most states of New England. More than 200,000 kids appeared live on the show during its run throughout the 1950s, 60s and 70s. The 3-hour show offered music, games, cartoons and life-learning lessons. This meticulously constructed documentary is a treasure of salvaged footage, including a 1952 kinescope, found on Ebay from Rex's early days at WPTZ in Philadelphia. While 'Boomtown' aired live every Saturday and Sunday, it was uncommon and expensive to record each show to videotape but the few that survived are classic eye-candy entertainment.

Miller unveils the worldwide threat to medical freedom of choice in WE BECOME SILENT: The Last Days of Health Freedom'. WE BECOME SILENT details the ongoing attempts by multinational pharmaceutical interests, giant food companies, and government agencies to limit the public's access to herbs, vitamins and other therapies. The film highlights the U.S. government's complicity in suppressing the truth about the effectiveness of alternative/complementary medicines, and outlines the international plan to eliminate freedom of choice in healthcare through the work of the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Narrated by Dame Judi Dench, the noted UK actress who has won multiple Golden Globe awards and dozens of other honors throughout her prestigious career, WE BECOME SILENT is a powerful statement about the dominance of multinational corporations over personal freedoms. The film describes the ominous bureaucratic shadow being cast by Codex, in concert with the World Trade Organization and others - and the challenges consumers face in trying to repel these monoliths from their daily lives. WE BECOME SILENT features the only known video from inside a Codex meeting, exclusive interviews with delegates to the Codex Alimentarius Commission, U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials, two U.S. Congressmen, actor Mel Gibson, and consumer activists from throughout the world.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDkwZjA1MjgtODgwZC00ZDRhLWFmZDYtZjFkZWU2OTUwZmQ4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2538874/","userScore":7.7,"voteCount":12,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":100000,"diretores":[["Kevin P.

Though she seems happy hanging out and playing with her pal Melissa, Xiara becomes defensive and emotional when talking about her father, Harold Linares.\n\nAs we see and learn, Harold is in jail serving a ten-year sentence for weapons possession; Xiara seems to blame his incarceration on her mother, whom she says \"kept calling the police.\" Xiara, who has always been extremely close to her father, acts out with her mother.\n\nAs we get to know Harold in prison, we find that he has ambitions to be a hip-hop star, and loves to sing rap songs whenever he talks to Xiara on the phone, or when she comes to see him in prison (the jail is in DC, only a few miles away). For her part, Xiara shares her father's love of music, and composes her own rap songs that she sings back at her father.\n\nUsually, however, despite putting on a brave front, Xiara's encounters with Harold end with her devastated, wishing she could be with him. Aracelli thinks that her desire to be with Harold is perhaps one reason Xiara gets into more trouble than other girls her age. Xiara admits to stealing when she was younger, so that perhaps she would end up in prison with her father.\n\nXiara was born in 1996, and has been the apple of her father's eye ever since. However, in the years leading up to his most recent incarceration, Aracelli and Harold have had problems. Both mother and daughter describe incidents where the parents fought in the presence of Xiara, in particular after Harold came home one day with lipstick on his clothes.\n\nXiara, who recalls how during sleepovers she and Melissa used to hide under the covers while her parents fought, has told her father she doesn't care if he and Aracelli split up - as long as she can be with him. The fact that he'll be in jail for such a long time is extremely upsetting to Xiara, who'll be 17 when Harold expects his release. Recently, Harold was moved from the D.C. jail to a federal prison over 300 miles away. Now, Xiara's only contact is the infrequent collect call from her father.\n\nXiara receives one of these calls while playing with Melissa; her father sings her a rap song he composed called \"7/27/96\" (her birthday) which communicates the deep and abiding love he has for his daughter. After Xiara and Melissa share their own duet for Harold, time runs out on the call - and Xiara collapses in tears. She is comforted by her grandmother (Aracelli's mom), who assures Xiara that one day, Harold will return, and \"It's gonna be all right.\"\n\nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS: Xiara's Song was directed by Academy Award®-nominated filmmaker Liz Garbus and produced by Rory Kennedy, who are award-winning partners and co-founders of Moxie Firecracker Films, an independent documentary production company.

It was always inconceivable that William Joyce, known to millions as 'Lord Haw-Haw', would escape the death penalty. However, just as with Roger Casement a generation earlier, it took considerable legal ingenuity on the part of the British establishment to ensure that Joyce was hanged. Lord Haw-Haw was the classic traitor. Broadcasting to millions from Nazi Germany, he played a part in sapping the collective spirit of wartime Britain. A grotesque figure, laughed at but secretly feared, his psychological defiance was mythologised by prolonged wartime anxiety. Hitler's Irishman: The Story of Lord Haw-Haw is a documentary by noted British feature film director, Brian Gilbert, for whom the story of William Joyce has been a lifelong obsession. In all Gilbert's work (e.g. 'Wilde', 'Tom and Viv', 'Not Without My Daughter'), he has sought to peel away the layers of complex characters and reveal the dark heart of fanaticism, self-invention and attachment to ideals at all cost. Hitler's Irishman: The story of Lord Haw-Haw is a creative documentary portrait of the compulsive and complex Irishman who recreated himself in a romantic and imagined ideal of Englishness, which he took to a monstrous and fanatical degree that would ultimately lead to his own undoing. Fascist thug? Irish intellectual? British traitor? German hero? Who, in fact, was the real William Joyce?","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465493/","userScore":6.1,"voteCount":20,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Biography","War"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":142000,"diretores":[["Brian Gilbert","nm0317981"]],"escritores":[["Brian Gilbert","nm0317981"]],"atores":[["Mary Kenny","nm1812994"],["Heather Iandolo","nm1955119"],["James Clarke","nm1949807"]]},{"title":"Finding Bryon","description":"In 1991, an unsolicited audition tape was sent to a casting director in Hollywood by a 17 year old boy named Bryon L.

In the year 2000, Josh and Steve (two failing, Hollywood wanna-be's) saw Bryon's tape and related to his disposition. Fed up with the constant rejection and disillusionment of Tinsletown, Josh and Steve left L.A. for Ohio to make a documentary about Bryon's life.

These impressions keep this otherwise beautiful country largely unknown and unexplored. Visions of Mexico documents an international cast of travelers who have abandoned their preconceived notions of Mexico for the chance to experience first hand the beauty of Mexicos rock climbing and culture. The film opens in the mountains of northern Mexico outside the city of Monterrey. Here, places like El Potrero Chico, La Huasteca, and El Salto see the much traffic from rock climbers, like Canadian athlete Steve Townsend, who come from all over the world to test their courage and strength. From there we travel down south to Mexico City, the largest city in the world, where we meet local strong woman, Chere Silva climbing the cave at Actopan. In addition to World Class rock climbing, Mexico City is a great departure point to explore the history and culture of Mexico. You can visit the Aztec pyramids at Teotihuacan, the volcano Popocatepetl, or Orizaba; the tallest mountain in Mexico. Our travels conclude with an adventure in the valleys of Guadalajara two hours east from the well traveled beaches of Puerto Vallarta. Ricardo Ramos, one of Mexicos strongest climbers, shows us the most difficult sport climb at his local crag, El Cuajo. Narrator, Jeff Jackson, highlights the history and culture of the areas traveled from his years of experience as a climber and traveler in Mexico.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469989/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":52,"budgetUsd":20000,"ageRating":"Unrated","diretores":[["James Carse","nm1972815"],["Jason Syesta","nm1974863"]],"escritores":[["James Carse","nm1972815"],["Jason Syesta","nm1974863"]],"atores":[["Marty Bland","nm1971292"],["Borre","nm1973706"],["Alfonso Campos","nm1974423"],["Alex Catlin","nm1974062"],["Nathalie Challulau","nm1971639"],["Diego","nm1964625"],["John Gonzales","nm1976981"],["Paco Medina","nm1975091"],["Alejandra Pacheco","nm0655247"],["Ricardo Ramos","nm1976911"],["Chere Silva","nm1972091"],["Steve Townsend","nm4846481"],["Emiliano Villanueva","nm0897908"],["Xavier","nm1977892"]]},{"title":"The Magic of Essaouira","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468804/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":50,"budgetUsd":60000,"diretores":[["Fouad Challa","nm1511034"]],"escritores":[["Fouad Challa","nm1511034"]],"atores":[["Houda Echouafni","nm1445342"]]},{"title":"Unprotected Senses","description":"A film about the extraordinary Russian-Jewish theater director Kama Ginkas, who survived the Holocaust as a child and became one of the most respected theater directors working in the world today.

He meets a photographer, Charlie Eckert, who shares his weariness at the barrage of violent images driving the global media. When Charlie offhandedly suggests bringing the balloon hats to random people around the world, Addi agrees, and the two of them set out on a journey to create a photo art book drawn from their adventures. Laden with backpacks full of balloons and cameras, Addi, a Silicon Valley slacker and Charlie, a Queens, New Yorker, forgo life in America during the dot.com boom to prove their thesis: people everywhere need joy to survive, whether it be the Balkan States in the aftermath of war, the strife-ridden Middle East, or the forgotten jungles of the developing world. As BALLOONHAT travels through different countries, it reveals not only the travails of a grassroots art project, but also America's changing status on the world stage. Each new culture's embrace of their balloon art - from Rio's beaches to the rubble of Sarajevo - stands in stark contrast to the narrowed world view Addi and Charlie find upon their return as they seek an outlet to spread the beauty of their project, and instead are forced to confront the realities of a post-millennial America.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMDUyOTYxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NzMzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481475/","userScore":7.4,"voteCount":26,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":88,"budgetUsd":65000,"diretores":[["A.G.

Democracy is fragile, and the experience of Germany in the 1930s and 1940s demonstrates how even a constitutionally governed nation could succumb to the rhetoric of despots. Without vigilance on the part of our lawyers and judges, the men and women who are charged with the task of safeguarding the rule of law, any nation is vulnerable to the effects of fear and propaganda.

This season, the students and staff prepare to defend their championship title. They look forward to their championship competition at Giants Stadium, but lack the hunger and determination of a team with nothing to lose. In reality, North Penn has everything to lose, and their desire to win was deteriorating into a fear of losing.\n\nBefore the band competes at championships, they venture outside of the circuit of competition they have dominated for twenty years to try their hand against some of the best bands on the East Coast. Despite a passionate and energetic performance at this competition, the band suffers a defeat which, when coupled with a series of poor rehearsals and performances, weakens the high school students' field show and self-confidence.\n\nBut the rehearsal before championships is the most focused and successful of the season, although some fear they will not be able to repeat this incredible performance at that evening's competition, especially considering the treacherous wind conditions on the field at Giants Stadium. This night would be particularly bad for marching bands, and their music, marching, and color guard equipment work would surely be affected by the strong gusts of wind.\n\nBut the adverse weather conditions and the strong possibility of a defeat only harden the band's resolve. Refusing to be defeated by the elements, their opponents, and their fears, North Penn conjures its will to win and fights to reinforce the organization's rich heritage.\n\nTake the Field shows the audience what it is like to be a member of a modern, competitive high school marching band. Gone are the days of the baton twirler, rock and roll medley, and high-stepping drum major. The modern marching band plays complex and sophisticated musical pieces, performs ballet, jazz, and modern dance, and executes a professionally designed and choreographed field show at the highest level of precision.\n\nNorth Penn High School, located in Lansdale, PA, houses close to 1000 students per class.

This powerful and poignant elegy called Cleophas and His Own and written by Hartley to assuage his grief at the loss of a young man he loved, is now a feature-length film directed by Michael Maglaras and produced by Terri Templeton of 217 Films. The film presents Hartley (played by Maglaras) seated in his makeshift studio in Corea in 1943 where, tired and ill, he recounts a tragic story to an unseen visitor of the sad fate that befell the Francis Mason family: a family of farmers and fishermen with whom he lived on a remote island in Nova Scotia seven years before. Using Hartley's text in its entirety and preserving the poem's thirteen-chapter structure, the film uses flashbacks and employs 24 of Hartley's paintings and drawings to tell of the events leading up to and following the Atlantic hurricane of September 19, 1936, when Hartley lost the young man who had become the love of his life. Following the death of this young man, the last seven years of Hartley's life were devoted to reliving these experiences through poetry and painting, leaving behind a body of work, second to none in the American experience, devoted to this young man's memory and his love the Mason family. 2005.

It is estimated that in the three months from April to July 1994, there were almost one million Rwandans killed, mostly Tutsi. Among those, there were many Hutu moderates, rivals of the so-called \"Hutu power\" extremists,. The night of April 6th 1994, the president in power, the Hutu exponent Habyarimana, was killed in an attack. A few hours later, the extremists took control of the Country and started mass murdering. It was surprising how many of the people took part in these killings. The genocide was carried out by armed militias made up mostly by local citizens. The homicide machine was perfectly prepared. The Department of Defence had bought an enormous quantity of arms from abroad, including \"unconventional\" weapons, such as six hundred thousand machetes from China. The killers were very efficient and were able to kill over ten thousand in only one day. Canandian General Romeo Dallaire's Blue helmets suffered losses, and this convinced the UN Security Council to withdraw the major part of the forces even while the genocide proceeded rapidly. Dallaire and his men didn't have a chance to stop the carnage, but still they were able to save around 25,000 people. The genocide didn't stop until General Paul Kagame, today's President of Rwanda, who headed the Rwandan Patriotic Front, defeated the Hutu extremists who controlled the government. As a result of an escape route in south-west Rwanda - made by the \"Operation Turquoise\", a French military exercise authorized by the UN officially to separate the victims from the killers - those responsible for the massacre fled into adjacent Zaire, today's Democratic Republic of Congo, and blended themselves into the flood of Hutu refugees who left their country to to escape from the raids organized by the Patriotic Front.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0833982/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":50,"budgetUsd":50000,"diretores":[["Maurizio Dell'Orso","nm0217290"]],"escritores":[["Maurizio Dell'Orso","nm0217290"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Mère fille, pour la vie","description":"Covers different types of women - more mother than woman, more woman than mother, extreme mothers, failing mothers - and the many moments in a woman's life, in particular when the woman becomes a mother or when the woman loses her mother.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI5YzE4YzEtMDk5MS00M2YyLWJhYjctN2M3ZDZhNDhiMzcxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR149,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459908/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":63,"diretores":[["Paule Zajdermann","nm0952148"]],"escritores":[["Caroline Eliacheff","nm0253428"],["Nathalie Heinich","nm1923622"],["Paule Zajdermann","nm0952148"]],"atores":[["Noëlle Châtelet","nm0154012"],["Marguerite Duras","nm0243921"],["Caroline Eliacheff","nm0253428"],["Annie Ernaux","nm1919741"],["Pierrette Fleutiaux","nm1924422"],["Nathalie Heinich","nm1923622"],["Doris Lessing","nm0504363"]]},{"title":"René Cabel, el Tenor de las Antillas","description":"This documentary is about one of the legendary figures of the Cuban bolero, René Cabel, known as The Antilles Tenor, as well as a tribute to the bolero and Cuba of the 40's and 50's.

They're the first same-sex couple to marry in British Columbia. Since then, many others have said 'I do' with pride. Gay and lesbian marriages are out of the closet! In 2003, British Columbia became the second Canadian province to recognize same-sex marriage. Filmmaker Cal Garingan looks beyond the headlines and introduces the eight couples who challenged the law in court. Why did they plunge into a scorching debate that meant their lives would be publicly judged? What does it mean to them to exchange marriage vows? Against the backdrop of playful weddings and heated protests, the couples ponder questions of love, family, faith and politics. Joy and Jane, who come from previous marriages, reflect on the significance of introducing each other as 'wife'. Bob and Lloyd ask if religious opposition means they must choose between God and their sexuality. Murray and Peter discuss why some people fear same-sex marriage, while Dave and Shane fought simply to have the choice. Garingan deftly intercuts colourful footage with commentary from the couples, their families and lawyer. The film also features acclaimed lesbian writer and activist Jane Rule - who disagrees with the focus on same-sex marriage rights - in a provocative conversation with some of the BC litigants. As controversy swirls around this issue worldwide, Why Thee Wed? offers surprising and diverse perspectives on what it means for gay and lesbian couples to walk down the aisle.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2268647/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":51,"diretores":[["Cal Garingan","nm1333996"]],"escritores":[["Cal Garingan","nm1333996"]],"atores":[["Cal Garingan","nm1333996"]]},{"title":"Whistleblower: Parking","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1836221/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"diretores":[["Claire Hughes","nm0400517"]],"escritores":[["Claire Hughes","nm0400517"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"A Letter from Greenpoint","description":"In the winter of 2003, Legendary Filmmaker Jonas Mekas, moved out of his loft on Broadway, New York, where he had lived for the past 30 years.

Although they try to build a new life and although they already dream of a new love to come, the young women cannot just let go of the man they ran from. In spite of the fights and the abuse they had to endure, they find it difficult to break up completely with their exes. The quarrels and the rows are carried on by telephone, quarrels about the past, debts and the children.

Historic photographs and illustrations blend with stunning modern film to create a fascinating portrayal of this much-loved Dorset town. Weymouth's story has a macabre edge to it: in 1348 the dreaded bubonic plague, known today as the Black Death, entered the country when an infected sailor stepped ashore on the harbourside. In 1588, as England defended her shores against the Spanish Armada, the San Salvador was captured off Portland and gleefully looted by the locals. Weymouth's popularity as a seaside resort was enhanced dramatically from 1789 onwards, when King George III frequently visited to bathe in the gentle waters of the bay. You will also re-live the history of Osmington's famous White Horse, the Roman Villa at Preston and the airfield that once stood on the nature reserve at Lodmoor. Weymouth suffered greatly in World War II, as devastating air raids destroyed much of the Chapelhay district, yet the town went on to play a key role in the path to final victory. In 1944 many thousands of American troops embarked from the harbour for the D-Day landings on the Normandy beaches.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1961661/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":87,"diretores":[["Andy Warren","nm3167976"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Racing for Possum","description":"Novice rally driver Peggy Bourne pays the ultimate tribute to her rally legend husband Possum Bourne, by competing in the world's most dangerous hill climb rally event, the Silverstone Race to the Sky.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470078/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Juliet Monaghan","nm0994376"],["Rachael Wilson","nm1982011"]],"escritores":[["Julian Grimmond","nm1450004"]],"atores":[["Peggy Bourne","nm1978232"]]},{"title":"Laugh at Us: The Merry Pranksters Theatrical Troupe for the Exceptionally Talented","description":"\"Laugh at Us\" follows the struggles of an acting troupe of mentally challenged adults as they work from script to stage in presenting an original full length comedy.

It is a celebration of cultural identity with deep historic and political meaning that emotionally connects with every Estonian, whether or not they live in Estonia. This massive ritual of song is unrivalled in the world. In Toronto, the extra-curricular Estonian School forms a choir of 60 second-generation Canadian youths of Estonian heritage with the hope that they'll become good enough to sing at the 2004 festival. This film follows the kids as they rehearse, get accepted to the festival (with 25,000 singers, you'd think everyone who applies would be accepted - not so!) and travel to Estonia to participate in this massive manifestation of cultural expression. The film allows these youths to anticipate what this trip will mean to them and, upon return, reflect on how it affected their view of their heritage.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4440632/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":24,"diretores":[["Ellen Valter","nm6390857"]],"escritores":[["Ellen Valter","nm6390857"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Sveiciens no Sibirijas","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032255/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":66,"diretores":[["Dzintra Geka","nm2659024"]],"escritores":[["Erik Lans","nm1118744"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"The Making of Lyla","description":"Behind-the-scenes footage of British rock band Oasis as they film the music video for their 2005 single \"Lyla\".","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4146826/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short","Music"],"runtimeMin":5,"atores":[["Tim Qualtrough","nm1465586"],["Phil Tidy","nm0862779"],["Gem Archer","nm1108344"],["Andy Bell","nm1262786"],["Katrine De Candole","nm1354790"],["Liam Gallagher","nm0302427"],["Noel Gallagher","nm0302462"],["Oasis","nm2089687"],["Zak Starkey","nm0823334"]]},{"title":"Here with Pride","description":"here! continues its real life Storyteller conversations, this time on the topic of gay pride.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc0NTYyNTEtMDNkNS00NWQ1LWIzZmYtZmI0MjA0MzRlOTU4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459655/","userScore":9.2,"voteCount":7,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":30,"budgetUsd":60000,"ageRating":"TV-14","diretores":[["Joel Lipman","nm0513514"],["Rick Scott","nm1726471"]],"escritores":[["Joel Lipman","nm0513514"],["Rick Scott","nm1726471"]],"atores":[["Malcolm Boyd","nm1851311"],["Howard Bragman","nm0103936"],["Jeff Bronsan","nm1926167"],["Tia Bruce","nm1917741"],["Anika Burt","nm0123406"],["Armand Cachero","nm1922211"],["Mark Caruso","nm1923120"],["Colly Carver","nm1919635"],["Elizabeth Conant","nm1921742"],["Amy Cook","nm1501576"],["E.

Taking his miniDV camera with him, Eric began shooting footage of the deployment and war whenever the chance arose, with the hopes of producing an hour long 'Wings' presentation for the Discovery Channel. This changed in November 2003 when a helicopter crew from the brigade's 5th battalion was shot down north of Tikrit. A week later, two more helicopters collided over the city of Mosul raising the casualty toll in the brigade to 12. The brigade would never be the same. After the memorial ceremonies, Eric began searching for stories within the brigade that would tell a broader view of the unit's experience. With the help of Flight Operations Sergeant Jason Rhoades he collected thousands of photographs from throughout the brigade showing hundreds of stories.

Its origins go back to the U.S. Civil War, where it was created as a training ground for Union soldiers, and eventually became a prison for captured Confederate soldiers. One unlucky Confederate soldier was even shot dead right about where the 50-yardline is today, and that event is re-created in this compelling documentary. After the Civil War ended, Camp Randall became the Wisconsin State Fairgrounds for many years, until this same plot of land played host to a new American sport called \"football\" near the end of the 19th Century, and has hosted this game ever since. \"In the Red Zone\" expertly tells the incredible history that has happened on this relatively small piece of earth. A star football player from a 1920s UW Badger team describes playing against Knute Rockne and the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame at Camp Randall. Watch as possibly the most loyal Badger fan in UW history attends a game, and describes how she has only missed one game at Camp Randall in over 70 years. Many important figures in Camp Randall's modern history, such as; Barry Alvarez, Ron Dayne, Pat Richter, Michael Leckrone, Terrell Fletcher, Billy Marek, and many others, share their stories about why this place is so special. The documentary even covers the latest major construction project at Camp Randall, which will serve as the basis for the next era of Camp Randall's history. \"In the Red Zone\" is simply the most comprehensive and compelling record of this important piece of Wisconsin's history.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTAwOTBlYjMtNWMyNC00NDkyLWFmMmItZDMxNzQyYWRmNDBhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR41,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044789/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":110,"budgetUsd":50000,"diretores":[["Justin Bomberg","nm1673581"]],"escritores":[["Justin Bomberg","nm1673581"],["Dan Presser","nm4595516"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"24 images de Antoine Duhamel","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861267/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":52,"diretores":[["Marie Pierre Jaury","nm1323177"]],"escritores":[["Marie Pierre Jaury","nm1323177"],["Philippe Langlois","nm4363183"]],"atores":[["Antoine Duhamel","nm0006051"],["Pierre Jansen","nm0006143"],["Patrice Leconte","nm0496312"],["Stéphane Lerouge","nm1489306"],["Bertrand Tavernier","nm0851724"]]},{"title":"La moitié des choses","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkxOWE3NjgtNGQxZS00MTQ2LThlNzYtOTRjNGRhZTgwNzBhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR46,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2322491/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":26,"budgetUsd":25000,"diretores":[["Nicolas Rostan","nm1242156"]],"escritores":[["Nicolas Rostan","nm1242156"]],"atores":[["Martin Rappeneau","nm1674139"]]},{"title":"Stalins deutsche Elite","description":"\"By order of the Soviet military administration, you have to work in the Soviet Union for five years.

The undisputed King of the Daredevils. The Last Gladiator. His exploits are legendary and it's unlikely his accomplishments or notoriety will ever be duplicated. He was a self-made sports superstar whose only competitor was Death. And it was a foe he faced regularly throughout his life. No one, including Evel, ever believed he would live to old age. But Knievel has never been a man who did what was expected. Today, as he enters the twilight of his life, he is paying a high price for the life he led. Blood transfusions from his many near death injuries left him with Hepatitis C. In 1999 he had a liver transplant to ward off death once again. While still outspoken and controversial, his health has been fragile since this surgery. Although he is only 66 years old, today he lives in pain from the incredible abuse his body suffered during his days as a daredevil. No one can say for certain just how much longer he can keep death at bay. This interview and documentary may very well be his last chance at a public forum, a final opportunity to set the record straight and share the philosophies that have guided his life. The documentary takes a non-traditional approach as the producers let Evel tell his story himself. With the exception of his son, Robby Knievel, this is a very rare and candid first hand account coming from the man who lived the legend. Evel is extremely candid about his exploits, his loves, his legend and the philosophies that have guided his life. The documentary is also a showcase for never before seen footage of his life and exploits making it, perhaps one of the best documentaries on Evel Knievel.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgwNTIzOGUtMmU2My00NWYxLWE3ZGItMmM5MzM0ZTJjZTliXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR97,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478966/","userScore":7.1,"voteCount":39,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Biography","History"],"runtimeMin":95,"escritores":[["George Butts","nm2143462"],["Sandy Dang","nm2113291"],["Alice Ikeda","nm2401317"]],"atores":[["Matthew McConaughey","nm0000190"],["Nate Golon","nm1963477"],["Ralph Fontaine","nm1863663"],["Evel Knievel","nm0460773"]]},{"title":"The Million Dollar Recipe","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451125/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Elise Pearlstein","nm1015409"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"A Sleepy Life","description":"The compelling story of three women who spend their days fighting an uncontrollable medical condition that causes them to spontaneously fall asleep.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4ZjQ1ZTgtNDFhMi00ZmE0LWE1MjEtYjk2NGQ3YmI5OWFhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR81,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2389146/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":44,"diretores":[["Justin Pemberton","nm1703633"]],"escritores":[["Justin Pemberton","nm1703633"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Ismo Alanko Säätiö - Live DVD","description":"The Finnish band Ismo Alanko Säätiö on stage at the Tavastia Club in Helsinki, Finland on October 22th 2004.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmUxODBhNDQtY2I0ZS00ZDgwLTlhMzktMzJjNTBiOGU0ZGRiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR7,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1760396/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"runtimeMin":56,"diretores":[["Petri Ylönen","nm1388079"]],"escritores":[["Aleksi Bardy","nm0054358"],["Eero Lämsä","nm1731014"],["Petri Ylönen","nm1388079"]],"atores":[["Ismo Alanko","nm0015978"],["Jarno Karjalainen","nm5231523"],["Timo Kämäräinen","nm1816005"],["Riku Mattila","nm1481804"],["Marko Timonen","nm3927765"]]},{"title":"Lost Worlds of Georgia","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758044/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","History"],"runtimeMin":45,"budgetUsd":30000,"diretores":[["Gary C.

Greenpeace launched one of its most significant campaigns in its history. Blockades, boycotts of Shell tankers, and mass protests not only forced Shell to adopt a genuinely environmentally sound solution (dismantling the platform on land), but also compelled the countries of the Northeast Atlantic to reach an agreement that no old platforms would be sunk in the region again.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0838173/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":45,"budgetUsd":200000,"diretores":[["Ludger Pfanz","nm0679323"]],"escritores":[["Ludger Pfanz","nm0679323"],["Gülsel Özkan","nm0960252"]],"atores":[["Al Baker","nm4054854"],["Ernst Benda","nm7045185"],["Joschka Fischer","nm0278996"],["Angela Merkel","nm1361767"]]},{"title":"Milk Chocolate","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33015500/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"atores":[["Sae Aikawa","nm16366981"]]},{"title":"Custom Ness","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2642200/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Erik Godal","nm1126004"]],"escritores":[["Erik Godal","nm1126004"]],"atores":[["Erik Godal","nm1126004"]]},{"title":"Parivartan: Tobacco Ban Documentary","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12024154/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":15000,"diretores":[["Prabu Duraisamy","nm11444519"]],"escritores":[["Bhaskar Gupta","nm11444523"]],"atores":[["Dinesh Duggar","nm11444520"],["Ashish Sharma","nm11444521"],["Rajnikant Sharma","nm11444522"]]},{"title":"Jaywalking","description":"\"JAYWALKING\" ventures into the world of up-and-coming drag king star, Jay Walker.

Can better answers be found in schools rather than political conferences? Lessons in Fear explores Israeli and Palestinian education from the ground up. In a media world obsessed with conflict, Lessons in Fear takes a humanized, behind-the-scenes look at how ordinary kids are educated in one of the world's trouble spots. The film looks carefully at the lives of students and teachers, who find themselves on the front lines intellectually and physically. Their battleground is one of knowledge and self-examination. Their challenges are a deeply engrained culture of violence, the denial of history and legacies of hatred, propaganda and segregation. Lessons in Fear is not a litany of wrongs. The film is a character driven portrait of courage in action as it presents an unvarnished look at the struggle to make education a positive force in Israel and the Palestinian Territories.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk3ZmRiNTQtMjhhZC00OTg5LTg2NDUtN2NkNDRlMWI0MWJlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,11,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6550438/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":80,"budgetUsd":200000,"diretores":[["James Cullingham","nm0191591"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Attention, ma mère regarde","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3649486/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Ekremcan Bakir","nm4371361"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Comet Hunters Asteroid Seekers","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16678022/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":77,"diretores":[["Dave Brody","nm1503090"]],"escritores":[["Dave Brody","nm1503090"]],"atores":[["Dave Brody","nm1503090"]]},{"title":"Galileo7: Family Matters","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1673378/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":60000,"diretores":[["René Ahlberg","nm3948767"]],"atores":[["Rene Auberjonois","nm0041281"],["J.G.
