Featuring interviews with media analysts and cultural historians, this documentary examines the patterns inherent in TV's disturbing depictions of working class people as either clowns or social deviants - stereotypical portrayals that reinforce the myth of meritocracy. Class Dismissed breaks important new ground in exploring the ways in which race, gender, and sexuality intersect with class, offering a more complex reading of television's often one-dimensional representations. The video also links television portrayals to negative cultural attitudes and public policies that directly affect the lives of working class people. Featuring interviews with Stanley Aronowitz, (City University of New York); Nickel and Dimed author, Barbara Ehrenreich; Herman Gray (University of California-Santa Cruz); Robin Kelley (Columbia University); Pepi Leistyna (University of Massachusetts-Boston) and Michael Zweig (State University of New York-Stony Brook).

In this journey toward the rediscovery of New York 20 years later, on the traces of a time long gone and a scattered community, Bertoglio is accompanied by his friend Walter Steding, Andy Warhol's ex-assistant, avant-garde painter and musician.

The US Chamber of Commerce is suspected of funneling millions of dollars to support ad campaigns against McGraw in the primary and the general election in a successful effort to defeat Justice McGraw as a part of what Forbes magazine described as a \"secret war\" against judges. The Chamber's shadowy efforts were joined in the general election by a group calling itself \"For the Sake of the Kids\" which spent millions supplied by a coal company executive in West Virginia to wage a smear campaign against McGraw alleging that he let a sexual predator loose to work in a school. That coal company executive has a pending $60 Million judgment against his company on appeal before the West Virginia Supreme Court, an appeal that will now be heard by the man he spent millions to insure was elected rather than McGraw. The Last Campaign is a sequel to the first film ever made by Wayne Ewing which was called IF ELECTED. That 1972 film covered Warren McGraw's campaign thirty-two years ago for a seat in the West Virginia State Senate. If Elected was broadcast by Bill Moyers in 1973 as a part of his series \"Bill Moyers Journal\" to critical acclaim: The Washington Star wrote that it was \"a documentary for the ages\" and The New York Times observed that the film was \"thoroughly absorbing.\" Wayne Ewing went on to make more than forty documentaries for television, along with creating the visual style of the dramatic TV series \"Homicide: Life on the Street.\" His most recent film is the feature documentary BREAKFAST WITH HUNTER about the outlaw Gonzo journalist Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. THE LAST CAMPAIGN incorporates scenes from its prequel IF ELECTED, making it a unique cinema verite chronicle of one man's career in politics, documenting both its beginning and end over a thirty-two year period. The film is also a reflection of how American politics has evolved over three decades.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481558/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":108,"budgetUsd":100000,"diretores":[["Wayne Ewing","nm0264009"]],"atores":[["Darrell McGraw","nm2069403"],["Warren McGraw","nm2066953"]]},{"title":"Ken Leishman: The Flying Bandit","description":"Family man - escape artist - bank robber!

One such example is Tata Steel, India's most iconic company, now internationally prominent because of its recent acquisition of Corus, Europe's second largest Steel Company. The story of Tata Steel is an epic saga that unfolds against some of the most significant historical events in India's history, right through the twentieth century. The film depicts this story through the means of a docudrama that introduces the stalwarts of the Tata family, who built the company, as well as the American Consulting Engineer, Charles Page Perin, who pioneered the adventure of setting up a steel mill in the middle of dense tropical forests in North Eastern India. The story spans Tata Steel's trials, tribulations and triumphs as it progresses through the British Raj during Victorian times, the two World Wars, and finally the contemporary era. It climaxes in the drama surrounding the high stakes auction leading to the acquisition of Corus. Apart from Jamshedpur where it all began, the film has been shot on location in London, Pittsburgh in the U.S. and in South-East Asia. The script of the film has been written by Stephen Alter, a novelist of international standing, and the narration has been spoken by the Oscar award- winning British actor Jeremy Irons. Featuring in the film as Sir Dorab Tata is the well known actor Victor Banerjee, and playing Charles Page Perin is the British stage actor Christopher Mellows. The cinematography is by Vijay Khambati and the music has been composed by Zubin Balaporia. The film is produced and directed by Zafar Hai.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjlkYTVlYWItNDBiMC00Yzg2LTk0MjMtMDYxOTQ5NzNiZjM0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR17,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9698958/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"diretores":[["Zafar Hai","nm0354017"]],"escritores":[["Dom Moraes","nm9205629"]],"atores":[["Kabir Bedi","nm0001934"]]},{"title":"Electric Showdown","description":"...as a $10 billion business stands on the edge of a knife, 50 reporters team up to cover video game history in the making.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmNmZmZlNmItNWQzNC00MzExLWJjZTUtMzFhYTZlNGQ2ZTgyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR158,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0857311/","userScore":7.3,"voteCount":20,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":105,"budgetUsd":10000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["David Chalker","nm0149951"]],"atores":[["Andrew Anderson","nm8669527"],["Charles Bank","nm4232858"],["Eddie Bautista","nm6478954"],["Scott Bedard","nm8669528"],["Craig Beers","nm8669529"],["Adam Buchen","nm8669530"],["Justin Calvert","nm8669531"],["Roger Chang","nm3773605"],["Bob Colayco","nm2538938"],["Ryan Davis","nm8669532"],["Brian Ekberg","nm8669533"],["Curt Feldman","nm8669534"],["Rich Gallup","nm5778626"],["Jeff Gerstmann","nm3568577"],["Carrie Gouskos","nm1930254"],["Michael Horn","nm3870184"],["Dino Ignacio","nm2016765"],["Greg Kasavin","nm2852704"]]},{"title":"A Family Affair","description":"This is the story of a talented musical family led by legendary musician Blondie Makhene and mother, Agnes.

She has lived in this life-saving machine longer than anyone else in the world, and she has lived most of those days in Lattimore, a small town located in southwestern North Carolina. At first the image and sound of the iron lung are distracting if not shocking, but soon after talking with Martha, the massive, metal cylinder becomes inconsequential because it is so greatly exceeded by her spirit. She says that she has survived for so many years ñ while so many others with the same disease died ñ because of the exceptional care she received from her parents and community and because she has always been driven to learn. Her personal story has long inspired her friends and neighbors, but Martha has been a private person for most of her life. With the assistance of her voice-activated computer, she wrote her autobiography, Breath: Life in the Rhythm of an Iron Lung. In the months since its publication, however, Martha has heard from people the world over who found something in her story that moved them, motivated them, or otherwise resonated with their personal experiences. This film tells Marthaís story in the context of Lattimore, the little town that has nurtured her throughout her life.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0819663/","userScore":8.8,"voteCount":8,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":45,"diretores":[["Mary M.

Still unknown and untold, this conspiracy underlines the climax of a political scheme successfully masterminded by Stalin to turn the Jews into the new enemies of the people. It reveals his extreme paranoia and his compulsion to manipulate those around him.

Disarm spans a dozen countries to look at how, despite a global ban, millions of antipersonnel mines continue to claim victims daily in more than eighty countries. Defined as a conventional weapon, antipersonnel mines inflict mass destruction upon civilian populations for decades after the initial conflict ends. Despite some twenty thousand casualties a year, mines continue to be used and stockpiled by governments and rebel groups. Disarm juxtaposes government and public opinion, that of diplomats, mine victims, deminers, soldiers and aid workers to explore the issues that both hinder and further the case against antipersonnel mines. Visually stunning, Disarm features harrowing footage smuggled out of isolated nation of Burma, scenes from war-ravaged Colombia and Iraq, never-before-seen helmet camera footage shot by Afghan and Bosnian deminers, unprecedented access into warehouses stockpiling millions of Soviet-made mines, and insightful comments by outspoken Nobel Peace Laureate Jody Williams. Looking beyond landmines, Disarm offers a contemporary, intelligent and critical investigation into how weapons systems, war, and the way it is waged are being redefined in the twenty-first century with devastating consequences.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MDM0NzQyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU3NjY0MQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0863013/","userScore":7.6,"voteCount":36,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","History","War"],"runtimeMin":67,"budgetUsd":264000,"diretores":[["Brian Liu","nm1986726"],["Mary Wareham","nm2386402"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Märchen-, Sagen- und Symbolfiguren: Märchenland Reinhardswald","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893543/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"diretores":[["Klaus Mierke","nm2438047"]],"escritores":[["Klaus Mierke","nm2438047"]],"atores":[["Michael Boyer","nm2255123"],["Hartmut Brand","nm1890014"],["Yvo René Scharf","nm1699099"],["Klaus Schubert","nm1853175"],["Dieter Uffelmann","nm1699177"],["Helmut Schopf","nm2170564"],["Klaus-Dieter Wiedemann","nm2041933"],["Katharina Kellwitz","nm2527972"],["Silvia Kleinschnittger","nm2472958"],["Christine Braun Rohde","nm1853165"],["Julia Witthöft","nm2528759"],["Antonia Schubert","nm2242416"],["Rolf Schließmann","nm2136007"],["Rebekka Vogelei","nm2525464"],["Sabrina Röhrs","nm2531197"],["Sarah Weber","nm2441663"],["Jessica Ruediger","nm2470161"],["Egon Haake","nm2506217"]]},{"title":"Lehrjahre beim Feind -

It begins with the Simpson family history and how they got into show business. The first part of the fake documentary follows the family from their weak beginnings to their exceptional prosperity. A television show, a recording contract, a lot of awards, and countless wealth follow Homer's inadequate video \"pilot\".\n\nHowever, problems begin to arise as the Simpsons' fame continues. After a funny stunt causes him injury (the cliff plummet from \"Bart the Daredevil\", after a montage of Homer injury clips), Homer becomes addicted to prescription painkillers, Marge makes some senseless business investments, and Bart goes to rehab after attacking flight attendants, being replaced on the show by Richie Rich. The IRS examines soon after and takes away their house (called \"Homertime\" as a parody of MC Hammer's house, \"Hammertime\"). Then, the family gets into a big dispute and splits up at the Iowa State Fair.\n\nFox is forced to put the show on hiatus, since none of the Simpsons will talk to each other. The members go their independent ways: Homer follows a career in the legitimate theater; Bart replaces Lorenzo Lamas as the star of the syndicated action show Renegade; Marge makes a nightclub act performing Bob Marley's song \"I Shot the Sheriff\"; and Lisa writes a tell-all book about her experiences and how Homer would slip anti-growth hormones into her cereal, entitled \"Where Are My Residuals?\". Bringing the family back together seems hopeless until country singer Willie Nelson puts on a phony awards show in order to reconcile the family. They hug and forget past wrongs in a sensitive reunion. Again, they look with hope to the many years of episodes of the Simpsons to come...or not.\n\nThe episode ends with an epilogue, in which the narrator states, \"...the future looks brighter than ever for this northern Kentucky family.\" Following the epilogue, the Simpson family is shown in a video editing room, viewing a scene from an upcoming episode, which Homer claims will be in the last season. The scene shows the family talking about winning a trip to Delaware, and was later used as an actual scene in the episode, \"Simpsons Tall Tales\". The final scene shows a mock teaser for an \"upcoming episode\" of Behind the Laughter about Huckleberry Hound, in which he reveals that he is gay.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478542/","userScore":7.3,"voteCount":30,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":29,"atores":[["Dan Aykroyd","nm0000101"],["Brian Dennehy","nm0001133"],["Bo Derek","nm0000137"],["Michael Ewing","nm0263989"],["Chris Farley","nm0000394"],["William Kerr","nm0449820"],["Rob Lowe","nm0000507"],["Lorne Michaels","nm0584427"],["Peter Segal","nm0781842"],["David Spade","nm0005450"],["Julie Warner","nm0000689"],["Robert K.

During the next 5 years, Yariv pursues these lost religious artifacts, hidden in the grounds of the Great Synagogue in the city of Oswiecim (Auschwitz) in 1939. For him, these artifacts embody his own perished family and guide his attempt for a closure and acceptance of the Polish people, usually regarded by Jews as collaborators and anti-Semites. Yariv manages to organize a unique archaeological excavation to unearth the treasure. But as the digging progresses, it becomes apparent that the synagogue's soil conceals a 60-year-old sinister secret and Yariv and his crew begin to lose hope. Until one morning a shovel hits a metallic object in one of the ditches.The search and excavation for the treasure translates within the film to a succession of poignant metaphors - to the Jewish existence in Poland and its annihilation, to the possibility of a dialog between the younger generations, to the capacity of Nazi evilness embodied in the presence of the nearby death camp and above all - to the growing sentiment that only 60 years have gone by and already WW2 and it's greatest nightmare - the Holocaust - is tragically transforming into an archaeological exhibit.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q1NDhlMGMtMzA1ZC00ODA3LTg1ZTUtOTZhNzk2NDdhMTA3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR93,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0759944/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":55,"budgetUsd":120000,"diretores":[["Yahaly Gat","nm0309490"]],"escritores":[["Yahaly Gat","nm0309490"]],"atores":[["Yariv Nornberg","nm3746092"]]},{"title":"The Perricone Weight-Loss Diet","description":"Nicholas Perricone, MD, FACN, is the author of three New York Times #1 Best Sellers; The Perricone Promise, The Perricone Prescription, and The Wrinkle Cure as well as the Clear Skin Prescription.

It was a time when the Holden car was ubiquitous in Australia but even though they were strongly represented on the race tracks - it was without factory recognition. To get around a world-wide ban by General Motors on motorsport, in 1969 Holden engaged the wily Harry Firth to manage a team called The Holden Dealer Team, supposedly supported by Holden retailers. What followed was Australian motorsport legend. From the team's first drivers in Colin Bond and Peter Brock in the Monaro GTS 350, through the Torana dominated seventies and the Commodore dominated early eighties. The documentary documents the mighty battles between the little Torana XU1 and big Ford GTHO Falcons, the domination of the Torana A9X, the stunning debut of the Commodore in the Repco round-Australia rally in 1979, and the emergence of Peter Brock as an Australian icon at Bathurst.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978332/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":65,"diretores":[["Charles Stewart","nm2266216"]],"escritores":[["Charles Stewart","nm2266216"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Genius Rory Gallagher Live","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480391/","userScore":8.7,"voteCount":12,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":60,"diretores":[["Barry Ryan","nm1685824"]],"atores":[["Rory Gallagher","nm0302484"]]},{"title":"4X Nós do Morro","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk1YWU4ZjYtMTFkMi00MWY2LThiODQtMTg2ZjU3ZDM5Y2IzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR93,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9691218/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":70,"budgetUsd":10000,"diretores":[["Cavi Borges","nm1485969"],["Gustavo Melo","nm1984734"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"'We Are the Boys...': James Beck","description":"A documentary about James Beck and his Dad's Army (1968) character, Pte.

FESTIVAL offers an engrossing and entertaining inside look at an intensely competitive subculture of high school-one that matters deeply to those who participate in it-as experienced by some of the most talented high school actors and actresses in Maine.

As young adults they experienced the Korean war, the civil rights fight and Vietnam. Their America was war torn, conservative and in a lot of ways, rife with fear. Then in the late 1960s thousands of them spontaneously dropped out of that America and somehow found each other in places like San Francisco. Fear became fun, nuclear mushroom clouds became mushroom trips, work became welfare, and repression became revolution. But by the mid-1970s the energy was fading and they started to drop back in. Or did they? Who were the hippies? Was it all peace and love? Did their ideology survive? What was it like on Haight Street in 1969? Or on a commune deep in the redwoods? Did they change anything? Did they learn anything? My Hippies explores the hippie revolution from the personal perspective of a hippie kid whose mother, step father, aunt and uncle all met on San Francisco's Haight Street in 1969. Still close friends and living in the same town, they share their experiences, pictures, 8mm films, unreleased psychedelic rock music, and thoughts about their wild trip as they face retirement and old age.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1538879/","userScore":9.1,"voteCount":9,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":48,"diretores":[["Caleb Clark","nm3672017"]],"escritores":[["Caleb Clark","nm3672017"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"The Making of ZOOP in Afrika","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTlkZjE0ZjEtNTgwMy00YzgxLTliYzUtOTA5YzQ5ZDg3YTVkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3953406/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":1000000,"diretores":[["Johan Nijenhuis","nm0631590"]],"atores":[["Sander Jan Klerk","nm1892541"],["Patrick Martens","nm0551706"],["Nicolette van Dam","nm1676007"]]},{"title":"Just Married","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGMxMTIxYWMtZjUzNS00NDZmLWE0NzEtMjkxZmFmYTkyZDBjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR46,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814169/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":70,"diretores":[["Ayelet Bechar","nm2289532"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Kurt Gerstein: Der Christ, das Gas und der Tod","description":"Portrays the Protestant Kurt Gerstein, who - although a member of the Confessing Church - joined the Waffen-SS in 1941 with the declared aim of gaining a glimpse into the machinery of the Holocaust.

We watch Jeri choose fifteen talented young singers from Nova Scotia's black communities, mentor them through a rigorous rehearsal process, and perform with them in front of the television cameras at St. Matthews. The music she selected for them to perform - gospel classics in vibrant new arrangements - originated in the Southern U.S., but it flows naturally from these youngsters, who have grown up performing it in the churches of their own communities. The range of talent exhibited by the young singers in the show is exceptional - especially given the fact that they have all been drawn from just a few small black communities within a 90k radius of Halifax, Nova Scotia. From a rousing duet on \"Thank You Lord\", to moving solos such as \"In The Garden\" and toe-tapping choral renditions of \"Children Go Where I Send Thee\" and \"His Eye Is On The Sparrow.\"","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487211/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":50,"budgetUsd":200000,"diretores":[["Kely Lyons","nm0529099"]],"escritores":[["Kely Lyons","nm0529099"]],"atores":[["Jeri Brown","nm2076711"]]},{"title":"Drei Wünsche, drei Frauen, ein Jahr","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0842535/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":85,"diretores":[["Corinna Belz","nm1326380"],["Bärbel Maiwurm","nm2353113"]],"escritores":[["Corinna Belz","nm1326380"],["Bärbel Maiwurm","nm2353113"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Oliva Oliva","description":"A filmed diary which chronicles two visits to the Olivas, a family of Spanish beekeepers from Salamanca, at the time of the honey harvest, in August and September.

Seen as individuals rather than cultural stereotypes, people from all over the world share their opinion of America, its government, its foreign policy, and its people. In the midst of growing international \"Anti-Americanism,\" real people tell Americans what they think and why in an attempt to further understanding and compassion. The United States of America is the world's only current Super Power. Some say we're benevolent. However, with growing Anti-Americanism around the world, we must ask ourselves: 'Are we really a Benevolent Empire?' Citizens of the US live in a media bubble. Unless one actively seeks out foreign and/or alternative news, we have no idea what is happening in the rest of the world. We don't know how the world population views us or our government - all we get is the vague \"They hate our freedoms\" from President Bush. Is it our freedoms that they hate or our foreign policy? Renowned historian Noam Chomsky speaks on the International Criminal Court and America's place in the world community. Civil Rights Attorney Michael Ratner talks about his clients from both Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo Bay. Global Exchange founder Medea Benjamin shares her experiences on humanitarian trips to both Afghanistand and Iraq. Together with individuals around the world, they voice their opinions on the international stage for the first time in a documentary of this scope. The voiceless will finally be heard. People are people. US Citizens empathize with the worldwide community when they see them as individual people, rather than cultural stereotypes. They all love their families. They all want to be safe. They all want to be happy. Then shop for food; they tend their gardens; they eat and they sleep.

Think again. Much of Eastern Europe has been devastated by the rapid transition from communism to capitalism. Fifteen years since independence from the former USSR, Ukraine - Europe's second largest country - is struggling to regain economic and social stability. One little-known consequence is the estimated 1,000,000 children currently living homeless on Ukraine's streets. \"Flowers Don't Grow Here\", filmed over four months and told through the eyes of a gang of Kyiv's street kids, offers an intimate and uncompromising portrayal of young people paying the ultimate price for political reform. Young mothers, united siblings, close friends and sworn enemies form a troubling underworld of society, governed by their own rules, and haunted by prostitution, crime, violence and murder.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTVlYTNjYmEtODY4Yy00N2JkLTgzYWYtMDBlYjczNzRiODQyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR81,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1550483/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":52,"diretores":[["Shira Pinson","nm2154531"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"The Law That Changed America","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1597267/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"atores":[]},{"title":"Against Human Rights: Film of a Lecture by Slavoj Zizek","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwZWQwYjMtMzQ5Mi00MjNlLWFkYTktZjg2NTQ3YjJjZTQyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,28,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8399190/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":1000,"diretores":[["Julio Pereira","nm9830742"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Nota Be","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0474276/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":52,"diretores":[["Dumé Gambini","nm2016368"]],"escritores":[["Dumé Gambini","nm2016368"]],"atores":[["Amalia Domenicu","nm2014086"],["Ghjacumu Luciani","nm2013527"]]},{"title":"CircleSpeak: A Journey Into the Heart of Crop Circle Country","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469051/","userScore":8.2,"voteCount":13,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":97,"budgetUsd":65000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Kirk Kirkland","nm1165628"]],"escritores":[["Kirk Kirkland","nm1165628"],["Laurence Newnam","nm1972668"]],"atores":[["Colin Andrews","nm0028614"],["John Lundberg","nm1753003"]]},{"title":"Capitanes de Arecibo La Masacre","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNlOWM3ZjctODM0ZC00ODI5LTg2MmItOWMwMDI5N2QyNWUxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt25811358/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":25000,"diretores":[["Omar Camilo","nm4409273"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Politics Life Religion 1","description":"The real American views on politics, life and religion from teachers, drug dealers, preachers, homeless, business owners, and more.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDIxNTU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDkxMjczNDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR16,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2313283/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary"],"runtimeMin":93,"budgetUsd":75000,"diretores":[["Marshall Mann","nm4717585"]],"escritores":[["Marshall Mann","nm4717585"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"Tópicos Urbanos","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQwNGE3YzMtMzBmYy00NzVlLTljMWItOWJjNzdkN2QzZTU3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,6,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21215848/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","History"],"runtimeMin":null,"budgetUsd":50000,"diretores":[["Ivana Mendes","nm4969266"]],"escritores":[["Kika Serra","nm4969654"]],"atores":[]},{"title":"'Cleopatra 2525' Special Effects","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780998/","userScore":null,"voteCount":0,"releaseYear":2005,"genres":["Documentary","Short"],"runtimeMin":null,"atores":[]},{"title":"Cliffs of Iron: Immigrants and Promise on the Marquette Range","description":"Celebrate Upper Michigan and take pride in the history of the Marquette Iron Range as told through the story of the historical landmark that is the Cliffs Shaft Mine.
