Keith 'Cheggers' Chegwin is a household name and has been at the top of his game for nearly 40 years. He's an all round entertainer and has lived with us via our TV screens on Swap Shop as kids through to GMTV as parents. He is undoubtedly a national treasure, and for nearly four decades has been much loved by viewers young and old. The year is 2010 and hidden away in a damp dark and blood stain cellar is a stranger, a man, a figure in the dark, someone we'd rather not know. He sits through the small hours torturing himself watching Swap Shop on fast forward over and over again. Cheggers Plays Pop posters decorate the cellar walls. The stranger moves slowly around his memorabilia filled shrine; terrifying equipment of torture fill the cellar together with several slabs of dead meat hanging from meat hooks. In the corner a man is bound and gagged in a cage while being subjected to archive TV clips of Keith Chegwin. The stranger is on an evil crusade. What is this unhealthy obsession with Keith Chegwin? Is the stranger plotting to kill our much loved Keith? Innocent victims from around the country slowly start to disappear. The damp cellar accrues more bodies. The news headlines build of reports of a serial killer. Cheggers continues his daily TV show while the nation lives in fear of evil roaming the country. Body parts begin to surface hundreds of miles from where they disappeared. How safe is Keith?

It was through the brave leadership of Sheriff Stone Williams (Rex Sikes) that eventually brought the end to the order. It was the end to a terrifying era in Spade County. Recently, several teenagers were found dead with no leads and nothing other than several bizarre pieces of evidence. The sole survivor and prime suspect Doug Porter (Mark Mundt) had suffered psychological damage and could not give an account of what happened. The Spade County Massacre, as it came to be called remained a mystery. Sheriff Stone Williams' investigation concluded the murders were committed by Charlie Zorborski, a disturbed teenager who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Doug Porter was no longer considered a suspect by Sheriff Williams and became a free man. However public opinion feels Williams made a mistake and Doug Porter was guilty. Today, Sheriff Stone Williams searches for answers to new bizarre and grisly crimes have resurfaced in Spade County. While the sheriff's department has no answers, the public fears The Order of Attollo has returned, others point the finger at Doug Porter. Porter, who has become an outcast, is forced to make a decision. He must either finally leave Spade County once and for all or prove his innocence. Doug unwillingly leads us through a night of violence and macabre as he discovers the truth to what really happened years ago in the tormented town called Spade County.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwNjU5MDI1NDReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDc4NTg0MTQ@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754714/","userScore":5.2,"voteCount":57,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Horror"],"runtimeMin":101,"budgetUsd":10000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Dean Chapman","nm4140533"]],"escritores":[["Dean Chapman","nm4140533"],["Kenneth Uzquiano","nm4140067"]],"atores":[["Mark Mundt","nm4137769"],["Rex Steven Sikes","nm0797697"],["Shawn Monaghan","nm3291312"],["Charles Ramsey","nm2753975"],["Brian Farr","nm4142831"],["Donny Polinske","nm4140038"],["Dean Chapman","nm4140533"],["Kassandra Gruszkowski","nm4140572"],["Lane Boyle","nm4137385"],["Vincent Martinez","nm4140165"],["Tommy Farr","nm4142198"],["Alex Gusavac","nm3309930"],["Tiffany Mooney","nm3905100"],["Greg Johnson","nm3434660"],["Liz Whitford","nm4139488"],["Chris Lorch","nm4143937"],["Loren Markiewicz","nm4142568"],["Phil Koch","nm4103233"]]},{"title":"The Ghost Footage","description":"Jason Greenwood films the haunting in his home in hopes to figure out what it wants.

Featuring interviews with leading film scholars and visual artists influenced by Le Fanu, Outliving Dracula seeks to redefine Le Fanu's critical importance as an Irish writer whose ghostly traces remain profound and enigmatic.
