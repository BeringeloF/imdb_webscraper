A modern plunge back into the worlds created by movies such as 'Deliverance' and 'Southern Comfort' but with a gritty British twang.

Sometimes just one sentence suffices to destroy everything you've built up like a house of cards. A respected doctor, beloved father, and husband (Ondrej Vetchý) faces very serious criminal charges. Overnight he exchanges his high-class address for a custodial-prison cell, a place from which proving his innocence proves difficult, especially when the opposition is being aided by a man who could be motivated by personal revenge. It's said that the truth always prevails over lies and hatred in the end, but that doesn't necessary guarantee victory.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhiYjNmNTItYzI5My00Y2I5LWEyZTctZDU1YzQ3ZmQxNzllXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Nevinnost","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1808331/","userScore":6.8,"voteCount":525,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":90,"revenue":1102022,"diretores":[["Jan Hrebejk","nm0398575"]],"escritores":[["Petr Jarchovský","nm0418588"],["Jan Hrebejk","nm0398575"]],"atores":[["Anna Geislerová","nm0312064"],["Ondrej Vetchý","nm0895384"],["Hynek Cermák","nm0148617"],["Zita Morávková","nm0608197"],["Anna Kameníková","nm4738823"],["Ludek Munzar","nm0613354"],["Miroslav Hanus","nm0361526"],["Daniel Czeizel","nm4873246"],["Alena Mihulová","nm0586261"],["Rebeka Lízlerová","nm4992599"],["Vera Hlavácková","nm5039719"],["Jirí Sesták","nm2517883"]]},{"title":"Blooded","description":"The tables are turned on a group of animal hunters in a remote location where no-one could hear them scream.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU2MzA5MmQtYjFkMS00NWNjLWE3ZTMtZTMwZWU4NDgxYzgxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1845211/","userScore":3.9,"voteCount":627,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Horror","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":80,"budgetUsd":250000,"diretores":[["Edward Boase","nm0090215"]],"escritores":[["James Walker","nm0907814"],["Edward Boase","nm0090215"],["Nick Clark Windo","nm2465403"]],"atores":[["Neil McDermott","nm1329794"],["Nick Clark Windo","nm2465403"],["Mark Dexter","nm0223316"],["Oliver Boot","nm1765085"],["Isabella Calthorpe","nm1671115"],["Cicely Tennant","nm1887084"],["Adam Best","nm1721126"],["Joseph Kloska","nm2743318"],["Sharon Duncan-Brewster","nm1004267"],["Tracy Ifeachor","nm3287940"],["Tim Bell","nm7707220"],["Jay Taylor","nm2497266"],["Pavel Bédi","nm6342876"]]},{"title":"Superstition","description":"The story begins with Johan (Shamsul Yusof), a young man working as a Hospital Assistant.

However, his blood type is so rare that only a few donors can be found who can reach the capital in time to help.

The victims--a middle-aged man killed at home, a dead woman found in the trash dump, and a teenage girl slain in the park--were all killed in grisly manners, but they didn't seem related to one another. With no clue to follow up on, Tam is decidedly at his wits' end. But when Chak is seriously wounded by a mysterious assailant, Tam deduces that the only way to uncover the truth is to get into the mind of the deranged killer, and in so doing he is forced to face a long-hidden side of himself.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMwY2ZkMTQtZDEyNC00YWRiLTkyODgtOGE3YjkyMGY4MmU3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"B+ jing taam","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1534786/","userScore":5.6,"voteCount":592,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":104,"budgetUsd":9000000,"revenue":1119052,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Oxide Chun Pang","nm0161152"]],"escritores":[["Oxide Chun Pang","nm0161152"],["Thomas Pang","nm2259114"]],"atores":[["Aaron Kwok","nm0477209"],["Patrick Tam","nm0848377"],["Beibi Gong","nm0327299"],["Hin-Wai Au","nm1336132"],["Eddie Cheung","nm0156567"],["Chi-Wai Lai","nm1708543"],["Ciwi Lam","nm3665943"],["Kai-Chi Liu","nm0514961"],["Eugenia Yuan","nm1067699"]]},{"title":"Tempo di reazione","description":"A family.

After the arrest of her extended family on multiple sex abuse charges, the teen-aged Rebecca recalls the events of her family's tragic past that will lead to what the press has dubbed \"The House of Horrors.\" Backtracking to 1956 when her Grandma Lila was first abused by her father, Rebecca recounts how her grandma tried to marry her way out of her plight only to find herself in a much more devastating trap that would last until her husband's death many years later. Rebecca then remembers how her mother Emily was made pregnant by her own father, only to have the baby die less than a year later, pushing Emily into a destructive cycle of abusive relationships, ending up with her cousin George, Rebecca's father. Rebecca's finally brings her family's history up to the present with her own recent abuse and the hellish birthday party that will ultimately lead to the arrest of her extended family and Rebecca's own removal to foster care. Drawn from over 16 years of experience videotaping confessions for the Brooklyn DA's Office, Michael P. DiPaolo's, I DON'T WANNA FEEL NOTHIN' NO MORE weaves together these three women's stories over the course of 50 years, allowing us to see how they were betrayed not only by those closest to them but also by many of the societal forces meant to protect them.","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825808/","userScore":5.5,"voteCount":16,"releaseYear":2011,"genres":["Drama","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":82,"diretores":[["Michael P.

Much to Sheldon's surprise, he finds the man is the husband of Annabelle, a young woman Sheldon had met in town and had an affair with the year before. A woman who suddenly disappeared off the face of the earth without ever telling Sheldon her full name. Now, as Sheldon looks for a way off the island, he is not only stalked by the man, but seems to see quick visions of Annabelle in the woods and on the lake. The game of cat and mouse between Sheldon and the man grows more intense as what appears to be the ghost of Annabelle drives Sheldon to the brink of madness.

Sem saber como nem porquê, vêem-se encurralados numa cave sem quaisquer hipóteses de fuga...o que irá acontecer? Mais tarde um outro rapaz que eles não conhecem é também deixado nessa mesma cave. Ao mesmo tempo é jogado com eles um estranho e macabro jogo psicológico que parece pôr em causa as suas vidas e que os irá levar até ao mais profundo do seu ser, até onde serão eles capazes de ir? Esta é a premissa do filme Até Onde? que nos irá levar até às profundezas do comportamento humano. Quando deixaremos de nos comportar com base no nosso eu social e passamos a ser controlados pelo nosso eu primitivo em que o mais importante é sobreviver a qualquer custo? Muitas vezes nos interrogamos o porquê de em certas situações de pressão agirmos de maneira diferente àquelas a que estamos habituados, seja no relacionamento com os mais próximos como com terceiros. A verdade é que só quando confrontados com tais situações nos poderemos, talvez, conhecer verdadeiramente. Este filme levar-nos-á numa viagem através das emoções, medos e sensações de três personagens que se amam e de uma outra que para eles é um simples desconhecido; durante a qual descobrindo que talvez o amor e compaixão que sentem uns pelos outros não seja mais forte que o seu desejo de sobreviver.
