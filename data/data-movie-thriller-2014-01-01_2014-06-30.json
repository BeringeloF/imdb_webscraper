Suddenly, a bullet breaks through a window, strikes a man's chest and breaks a TV screen, causing everyone to panic. Conan stays calm and, using the zoom function on his tracking glasses to follow the path of the bullet to its source, spots the sniper. He and Masumi Sera, who had been present at the Tower as part of an assignment to shadow the victim, pursue the fleeing culprit on Masumi's motorcycle, but the chase takes a violent turn when the suspect uses a handgun and even hand grenades to take out his pursuers. Even the FBI get involved in the chase, but the culprit and the mysteries of the sniping end up vanishing into the ocean.\n\nThe investigation turns up a connection to the special United States Navy squadron, the Navy SEALS and other former US military officers working in Japan. However, the first sniping was just the beginning; as more people are shot, the citizens of Tokyo panic! What is the meaning of the rifle case and dice left behind? As his investigation progresses, Conan soon finds himself in the sniper's cross-hairs, only to be saved by Masumi who intervenes and takes the bullet in his stead. And, in the background, Subaru Okiya begins to make his move...\n\nThe sniper/culprit is Kevin Yoshino, while the entire murder plan was created by his master Timothy Hunter. Kevin became Hunter's student and helped him carry out the plan because he wanted to repay Hunter for saving his life during their war operations in the Middle East.\n\nThe reason for the serial killings was that Waltz was jealous of Hunter's achievements, which belittled his own actions. Waltz set Hunter up so he wouldn't get the Silver Star. He even ordered Murphy to assassinate Hunter, but the bullet failed to kill him, although a fragment of it remained in Hunter's skull and damaged his optical nerves, severely impairing him. Yoshino eventually discovered the deception, but Waltz destroyed the evidence before it could be used in court, driving Hunter into conceiving his revenge plan. The five sniping positions used for the murders, if viewed from ground level, combine to form a pentagon, which marks the five points of a Silver Star.\n\nKevin attempted to kill Waltz, but Conan saved the latter by kicking a ball at him to knock him out of the bullet's way. Kevin then attempted to kill Conan, but Subaru saved him. Ran, unaware of Conan's plan of saving Ayumi decides to go after Kevin herself but trips ends up being Kevin's target. She is saved thanks to the combined effort of Conan and Subaru, and she manages to take Kevin down after that - for Ayumi, for Sonoko and for Sera. In the end, Subaru Okiya answers a call from James Black with Shuichi Akai's voice.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ5Y2RmZGMtN2I4NS00OWNlLWI1YzAtNjUxNzcwNDA4Y2IxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Meitantei Conan: Ijigen no sunaipâ","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3455204/","userScore":6.7,"voteCount":1776,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Animation","Action","Adventure","Crime","Family","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":110,"budgetUsd":10000000,"revenue":42028116,"diretores":[["Kôbun Shizuno","nm2032664"]],"escritores":[["Gôshô Aoyama","nm1108327"],["Kazunari Kouchi","nm2557097"]],"atores":[["Minami Takayama","nm0847439"],["Kappei Yamaguchi","nm0945322"],["Wakana Yamazaki","nm0906722"],["Rikiya Koyama","nm0468711"],["Noriko Hidaka","nm0383022"],["Shûichi Ikeda","nm0407454"],["Miyuki Ichijô","nm0406708"],["Iemasa Kayumi","nm0443509"],["Kiyoyuki Yanada","nm0363066"],["Ryôtarô Okiayu","nm0645636"],["Chafûrin","nm0149218"],["Kazuhiko Inoue","nm0409287"],["Wataru Takagi","nm0847085"],["Atsuko Yuya","nm1111384"],["Ken'ichi Ogata","nm0644524"],["Megumi Hayashibara","nm0370677"],["Yukiko Iwai","nm0412520"],["Ikue Ôtani","nm0649026"]]},{"title":"Man from Reno","description":"A mystery outside of San Francisco brings together small-town sheriff Paul Del Moral, Japanese author Aki Akahori, and a traveler from Reno who soon disappears, leaving behind his suitcase and a trail of questions.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5NDA2NDg1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM1NDQ1MzE@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,9,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2287170/","userScore":6.6,"voteCount":2240,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Crime","Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":111,"revenue":101438,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Dave Boyle","nm2279419"]],"escritores":[["Dave Boyle","nm2279419"],["Joel Clark","nm2748313"],["Michael Lerman","nm2784610"]],"atores":[["Ayako Fujitani","nm0297858"],["Pepe Serna","nm0785277"],["Kazuki Kitamura","nm0457556"],["Yasuyo Shiba","nm4938249"],["Hiroshi Watanabe","nm1073975"],["Tetsuo Kuramochi","nm5017229"],["Yuki Matsuzaki","nm1452105"],["Shiori Ideta","nm4680946"],["Elisha Skorman","nm1801474"],["Masami Kosaka","nm1402611"],["Rome Kanda","nm0437172"],["Ross Turner","nm3129298"],["Thomas Cokenias","nm3463291"],["Geo Epsilanty","nm3287300"],["Ron Eliot","nm2466590"],["Nanami Iwasaki","nm5686441"],["Yoshi Ishii","nm2473587"],["Sarah Kei Brooks","nm5536450"]]},{"title":"Thegidi","description":"A plainclothe officer falls in the hands of phony agents ,which sets off repercussion ending in series of a massacre events.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZhZmExYmEtZTgwOS00NDRlLWI2MWItZDg0MDk3YjM1NGQzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR3,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3565264/","userScore":7.6,"voteCount":3162,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":126,"revenue":76000000,"diretores":[["P.

Set in Hollywood 1957, a time of glitz and glamour, a time of brains and blood. This movie is full of action, suspense, gore and graphic violence. George A. Lazarus is an insurance investigator who disappears during a routine claim. His heartsick fiancee, Bethany, retraces George's steps and discovers that the employees George was investigating also all mysteriously disappeared. Now, as Beverly finds herself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, this simple insurance fraud case may actually be the beginning of the end of the human race. The Day of the Living Dead revolves around the character of George A. Lazarus (Ray Capuana, Emerging Past), an insurance investigator who schedules routine interviews with twelve employees and owner Mammon Beelzebub (played by Churchill, writer/director The Emerging Past, Check Point) of the Deadly Sin Cigarette Company upon the receipt of a rather suspicious insurance claim. In the process, he learns that all twelve had recently been fired for being sick at the job, and then subsequently and without a trace, they disappeared. Two weeks later, with Lazarus now a missing person, his heart-sick fiancee Bethany Loomis (Natalie Victoria, Dead Head) and Chip (Kevin Eugene Franklin) undertake the task of finding him. While retracing his steps, they learn that what was initially regarded as a simple fraud investigation case may actually be the beginning of the end of the human race. Set in Hollywood in 1957.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg1ZmM4NzEtZDAzYS00MDc3LWIyY2ItMjJlZmQyNDNjZGFjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"Lazarus: Apocalypse","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2366806/","userScore":2.3,"voteCount":1909,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Crime","Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":90,"ageRating":"TV-MA","diretores":[["Thomas J.

If Tommy returns, the city will explode. And if he doesn't ... something even worse might happen. TOMMY is the story of the woman behind the man behind the headlines. A modern myth about when the Queen returned and the city burned. About two sisters, two mothers, three daughters and their men.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzOTYyODY2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI1MjcwMTE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3411420/","userScore":5,"voteCount":1223,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Crime","Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":92,"budgetUsd":26000000,"revenue":470338,"diretores":[["Tarik Saleh","nm0757975"]],"escritores":[["Anton Hagwall","nm6160657"]],"atores":[["Moa Gammel","nm0303973"],["Lykke Li","nm3040319"],["Ola Rapace","nm0635262"],["Alexej Manvelov","nm3160438"],["Johan Rabaeus","nm0704708"],["Inez Buckner","nm6246991"],["Ewa Fröling","nm0297083"],["Ingela Olsson","nm0648065"],["Alexander Stocks","nm2655984"],["Azzan Jack","nm6160645"],["Amanda Ooms","nm0648975"],["Mahmut Suvakci","nm3776071"],["Alexander Ljung Boyea","nm6246992"],["Egil Linge","nm6160647"],["Ramou Jack","nm6160648"],["Martin Milliarino","nm6160649"],["Nina Lindén","nm6246993"],["Otto Nilsson","nm4876791"]]},{"title":"Guardian","description":"After the mysterious death of her undercover cop husband, a female martial artist must protect her daughter from corrupt police, politicians and hired assassins who will do anything to conceal the truth.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA1NTE1M2MtMmY1OS00N2NmLTg0M2QtZWUwOTM2MTk3ZmY4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3652714/","userScore":4.1,"voteCount":206,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Action","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":91,"budgetUsd":3500000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Helfi C.H.

Each believes she's traveled to the house on business, but they all agree that something seems strange. For one thing, the entire house is full of pictures and statues of pigs. The women all come from drastically different walks of life. None of them would have chosen to spend the night together in such an eerie place, but the last ferry for the mainland has just left, and a terrible storm is rolling in. Trying to make the best of an unpleasant situation, they raid the mansion's wine cellar and throw a party. As the night creeps on, however, it becomes clear that someone--or something--has lied to get them in the house. It's not long before someone mentions that Spektor Island is supposed to be haunted. Of course, no one in the house believes in ghosts. At least, not until the first murder. What do an actress, a religious zealot, a renegade, a coed, a model, a singer, a medium, a real-estate investor, a historian, and a doctor have in common? None of them is who they seem. Yet, the fate of the entire world may rest in their hands.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MzUwMzgzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI5MzAxOQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","originalTitle":"","imdb_url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2496400/","userScore":3.4,"voteCount":630,"releaseYear":2014,"genres":["Adventure","Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"runtimeMin":83,"budgetUsd":25000,"ageRating":"Not Rated","diretores":[["Sophia Cacciola","nm4677186"],["Michael J.

A Japanese radio station had learned about the existence of a tape containing the voices of the hostages while they were still alive, and made it public. It was Nakahara Seiichi, a journalist with the radio station, who had received a phone call from Hirasawa Hitomi, a family member of one of the victims. According to Hitomi whose mother Sakiko was killed in the terrorist incident, the government army working to resolve the case at that time planted wiretaps and the voices of the hostages were in it. She had that audio tape in her possession and talked about wanting to know her mother's last moments. What was compiled is a \"recitation of life\"; daily stories of memorable events to each of the six captives of different occupations and ages. Dojima Hiroshi, an unknown writer; Takahashi Satoko, an ordinary housewife; Hirata Ryohei, a plant manager; Kuraki Shoko, a company clerk; Eto Takahiro, a tour guide; and Sakiko, a food lecturer.
